<small>MEN AND WOMEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Certain aspects of Washington, both outward and
inward, are like Paris. Especially is this true of
the outward aspect on a wet night, when the circles
of yellow-flaring gas lamps are reflected in the shining
expanse of asphalt, when the keen-flashing
electric lights blaze upon the white fa&ccedil;ades of
great buildings and the numerous groups of statuary
against a black background of shrubbery,
and when some convention or other brings crowds
of people to swarm upon the usually dull Washington
streets. The Honourable Geoffrey Thorndyke,
M.C., spoke of this Parisian resemblance to his
colleague, the Honourable Julian Crane, M.C.,
as they sat together on a warm, rainy April night
in the bay-window of Thorndyke&#8217;s apartment.
The rooms were lofty, wide, and dark, according
to the style of forty years ago, and overlooked one
of those circular parks in Washington which fashion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
seemed only to have patronised briefly in order
to desert permanently. But the rooms and the situation
suited Thorndyke perfectly, and he had
spent there all of the five terms of Congress which
he had served. Thorndyke&#8217;s remaining in that
locality secretly surprised Crane, a man from the
Middle West. He himself had an apartment in a
modish hotel, which cost him more than he could afford
and was not half so comfortable as Thorndyke&#8217;s.
But then Thorndyke was born to that
which Crane was toilsomely achieving&mdash;for this vigorous
product of the Middle West was sent into the
world with enormous ambitions of all sorts, and not
the least of these was social ambition. And combined
with this social ambition was a primitive enjoyment
of society such as the Indian gets out of his
pow-wows with unlimited tobacco and fire-water.
Crane, although bred on the prairie, cared nothing
for fields and woods and the skies of night and the
skies of morning. Men, women, and their affairs
alone interested him. Thorndyke, on the contrary,
although town-bred, cared for the God-made
things, and at that very moment was studying with
interest the great tulip-tree, dark and dank before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
his window. When he made the remark about Washington
having sometimes a look of Paris, he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;And I expected to be in Paris at this very moment
but for this&#8221;&mdash;here he interjected an impolite
adjective&mdash;&#8220;extra session. However,&#8221; he continued,
good-humouredly, &#8220;I hardly expect you to
agree with me, considering your late streak of luck&mdash;or,
rather, your well-deserved promotion, as I
shall call it on the floor of the House.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane acknowledged this with a smile and a request
for another cigar, if possible, not so bad as
the last. He was tall and well made, and had a
head and face like the bust of the young Augustus
in the Vatican gallery. He was elaborately
groomed, manicured and all, judging that time
spent on beauty like his was not thrown away. In
contrast to this classic beauty was Thorndyke&mdash;below,
rather than above, the middle height, with
scanty hair and light-blue eyes, and who could not
be called handsome by the mother that bore him.
But when women were about, Geoffrey Thorndyke
could always put the handsomest man in the room
behind the door.</p>

<p>And he had a peculiarly soft and musical voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
which made everything he said sound pleasant,
even when he proceeded to make uncomfortable remarks
about the late turn in national affairs which
had sent Crane&#8217;s political fortunes upward with a
bound.</p>

<p>&#8220;For my part,&#8221; he said, knocking the ash off his
cigar, &#8220;I have lived long enough and read enough
to know that such a stupendous opportunity as
your party has now is generally fatal to that party
before the next Presidential election. See&mdash;in the
middle of a Presidential term, you carry the Congressional
elections by a close shave. The new Congress
is not expected to meet for thirteen months
afterward. The Brazilian matter reaches an acute
stage, and the President is forced to call an extra
session in April instead of the regular meeting in
December. Of course, the Brazilian matter will
come out all right. Any party, at any time, in any
civilised country, is capable of managing a foreign
affair in which all the people think the same way.
But when it comes to domestic affairs&mdash;my dear
fellow, when the President saw how things were going
and that he really could invite you to make
fools of yourselves for the next fourteen months<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
before the Presidential convention, it was beer and
skittles to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane turned in his chair and sighed. The intricacies
of national politics, the wheels within
wheels, the way of putting out a pawn to be taken,
puzzled and confused him. It had seemed to him the
most unmixed political good to him when his party
had secured control of the House at an international
crisis. It could vote supplies with splendid profusion,
it could shout for the flag, it could claim
the credit for everything done, while the Senate
and the Administration being in opposition, very
little real responsibility attached to anything the
House might leave undone. And when the man
who was certain to be the caucus nominee for
Speaker had sent for Crane at one o&#8217;clock in the
morning and had offered him the chairmanship of
the Committee on Foreign Affairs to succeed Thorndyke,
Crane had felt his cup of joy to be overflowing.
Everything was in his favour. Without the
least doubt about his powers, which were considerable,
he had some diffidence on the score of experience;
but Thorndyke, who would be the ranking
member of the minority on the committee, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
help him out, quietly and generously. In the midst
of his elation Crane remembered that Thorndyke
had not been wholly satisfied with the chairmanship
of that great committee&mdash;and Thorndyke had been
suffered to exercise a degree of power far greater
than Crane felt would be permitted him for some
time to come. On most Congressional committees
there are two or three men who have come into the
world booted and spurred, while the remainder were
born saddled and bridled. Thorndyke was one of
those who got into the saddle early, and yet, the
saddle or the steed had not seemed to suit his taste
exactly. Crane spoke of this, and bluntly asked
the reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; replied Thorndyke, coolly, &#8220;there
was no more promotion for me&mdash;and I was made
to accept it, whether I wanted it or not. You see,
although the Constitution guarantees every State
a republican form of government, all the States
don&#8217;t have it. Mine hasn&#8217;t, nor has yours. My
boss, however, is a good deal more astute than your
boss. Mine never lets any man have what he wants.
Unluckily, when I was a Congressional tenderfoot
I wanted the earth and the fulness thereof, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
worked for it as well as I knew how. When the next
nominating convention was held I was left out in
the cold world. I waited two years. Then, being
still green, with all the courage of inexperience, I
went to my boss. I said to him that I wished to get
back in public life, and to stay there&mdash;and he
said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorndyke paused and blushed a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with it,&#8221; said Crane, encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boss has some extraordinary virtues&mdash;all
real bosses have&mdash;among them a very engaging
frankness. He said, without beating about the
bush a moment, that it wasn&#8217;t his policy to promote
men who might&mdash;who might one day get a little
too big for him. That was about what he said.
He told me if I would be satisfied with a seat
in Congress and the chairmanship of a good committee,
I could have it as long as I kept out of State
politics, and didn&#8217;t make myself offensively prominent
at national conventions. Then he proceeded
to advise me as Cardinal Wolsey advised Thomas
Cromwell. He charged me to fling away ambition,
and reminded me that by that sin the angels fell,
and likewise a number of very imprudent young politicians&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
don&#8217;t use the word statesman any more&mdash;all
over the State. I squirmed, and the old fellow
grinned and told me if at any time I hankered
after a foreign mission I could get it. I thanked
him and told him I had no fancy to be buried until
I was dead, and at last we compromised on his first
proposition. I like the life&mdash;God knows why. The
salary is enough for me to live on and support an
invalid sister&mdash;all I have in the world. I have sense
enough to see that I am better off than if I gave a
loose rein to my ambition and was forever chasing
rainbows. A man without fortune, who lives upon
the hopes of an office which will beggar him if he
gets it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; cried Crane, suddenly interrupting,
his eyes lighting up with anxiety. &#8220;That&#8217;s it,
Thorndyke. I know all about it. I&#8217;ll tell you the
whole story&mdash;the story I never even told my
wife&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There is something touching and appealing
when a man lays bare his wounds and bruises.
Thorndyke, without saying a word, gave a look, a
slight movement of the head that brought out
Crane&#8217;s story. He told it readily enough&mdash;he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the mobile mouth and quick imagination of the orator,
and he was always eloquent when he was talking
about himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, when I got the nomination to Congress
it was that or bankruptcy. For two months before
the convention was held I&#8217;d walk the floor half the
night, and the other half I&#8217;d pretend to be asleep,
to keep my wife from breaking her heart with anxiety.
Annette is a good woman&mdash;too good for me.
I had neglected my law practice for politics until I
had no practice left, and then I was transported to
Congress and Heaven and five thousand dollars a
year. I determined to do two things&mdash;cut a wide
swath in Washington and save one-third of my salary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great fool&mdash;you,&#8221; murmured Thorndyke, sympathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know what a wide swath was. I
didn&#8217;t know anything about it. I came to Washington
and brought my wife and three children.
We went to a boarding-house on Eleventh Street&mdash;you
called to see us there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I remember thinking Mrs. Crane the prettiest,
sweetest woman I had seen that season.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>This was true, for Annette Crane had the beauty
of form, of colour, of sweetness and gentleness to
an extraordinary degree. She was no Perdita&mdash;no
one would have taken her for a princess stolen in
infancy. But not Ruth in the harvest-field was
more natural, more sweetly graceful than this lady
from Circleville, somewhere in the Middle West.</p>

<p>&#8220;Annette admired you tremendously,&#8221; continued
Crane, in the easy tone of a man who knows his
wife is desperately in love with him, and thinks her
fully justified. &#8220;She said it was kind of you to
call. Like me, she thought we were going to do
wonderful things&mdash;I believe she used to pray that
our hearts might not be hardened by our social triumphs.
Well, you know all about it. We were
asked to the President&#8217;s receptions, and my wife
called on the Cabinet officers&#8217; families, and at the
houses of the Senators and the Representatives from
our own State. We were asked to dinner at our
junior Senator&#8217;s house. I thought it would be
grand. It was, in a way&mdash;the old man is pretty
well heeled&mdash;but it was exactly like one of those
banquets a Chamber of Commerce gives to a distinguished
citizen. Annette was the prettiest woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
there, but she didn&#8217;t wear a low-necked gown like
the other women, and that embarrassed her. In the
end she found out more things than I did. She said
to me before the season was over:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Julian, it&#8217;s not being rich that makes people
in Washington. If it were, we shouldn&#8217;t mind not
being in it. But there are plenty of people, like the
Senator, who have the money and the wish to make
a stir socially&mdash;but they can&#8217;t, while a plenty of
poor ones do. Look at Mr. Thorndyke&#8217;&mdash;she hit
upon you the first man&mdash;&#8216;he&#8217;s asked everywhere,
and he says he is as poor as a church-mouse. No,
Julian, to be as you would wish to be here, needs
not only the money we haven&#8217;t got, but something
else we haven&#8217;t got and can&#8217;t acquire, so let&#8217;s give
it up. Another winter I&#8217;ll stay in Circleville&mdash;it
will be better for the children, better for me, better
for you&#8217;&mdash;for I own up to having been deuced surly
all that winter. So we adopted that plan, and Annette
has never been to Washington since. But&mdash;I&#8217;ll
confess this, too&mdash;I had from the beginning a
fancy to see the inside of those houses where the
people live who make up this world of Washington.
It wasn&#8217;t merely idle curiosity. I was convinced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
and I am so still, that the number and
variety of people in Washington must make these
Washington parlours&mdash;drawing-rooms, you call
them&mdash;the most interesting of their kind in the
world. Well&mdash;I&#8217;ve got into some of them. It&#8217;s a
good deal easier for a man without his wife than a
man with her; and Thorndyke, I own up, I am bewitched.
Oh, it&#8217;s not so much to you; you&#8217;ve known
it too long, and seen too much of it all over the
world to know how it strikes a man born and
brought up until he is thirty-five years old in
Circleville. I swear when I get a dinner invitation
I am like the girls out our way, who will drive twenty
miles in a sleigh to go to a dance. The mere look
of the table&mdash;the glass, the silver, the flowers&mdash;goes
to my head. The terrapin intoxicates me.
Those quick, soft-moving servants fascinate me.
And the conversation! They let me talk all I
want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a vastly entertaining fellow in your
own mental bailiwick,&#8221; interjected Thorndyke.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the women! So unaffected&mdash;so unconscious
of their clothes! And such listeners! I have
never been to a stupid dinner in Washington. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the club&mdash;I never knew a man of leisure in my life
until I came to Washington. I daresay you think
me a fool.&#8221; Crane paused, with a feeling rare to
him that he could not express half what was in him,
but Thorndyke&#8217;s knowledge supplied the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. It is quite as you say, but you
are taking it all too seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Circleville,&#8221; murmured Crane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, three-fourths of these people you so admire
came from Circlevilles. Forty years ago, how
many of them, do you think, had a servant to answer
the door-bell? Just consider, my dear young
friend, that, except at the South, servants were unknown
to a large proportion of the American people
until a short time ago. The parents of these
people you see here, with eighteen-horse-power automobiles,
and with crests upon their writing-paper,
their carriages, their footmen&#8217;s buttons, thought
themselves in clover when they could afford a maid-of-all-work.
So far, they are merely at the imitative
stage. Their grandparents were pioneers and
lived mostly in log cabins, and although the three
generations are divided by only fifty years, it is as
if &aelig;ons of time existed between them! By Jove! It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
is one of the most astounding things in American
life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; replied Crane. &#8220;It is said that one-half
the world doesn&#8217;t know how the other half
lives, but in these United States about nine-tenths
of the society people have no more notion how their
grandparents lived than they have of life on Mars
or Saturn. I went to a wedding the other day. It
was magnificent beyond words. The two young
people had been brought up in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barbaric luxury,&#8221; Thorndyke interrupted.
&#8220;It&#8217;s barbarous to bring children up as those two
were&mdash;I know whom you mean. The girl had her
own suite of rooms almost from her birth, her own
maid, her own trap. Even when there was an affectation
of simplicity it cost enough to have swamped
her grandfather&#8217;s general store at Meekins&#8217;s Cross
Roads, where he laid the foundation of his fortune.
When she came out in society it simply meant more
of everything. No daughter of the C&aelig;sars was
ever more conscious of the gulf between her and the
common people&mdash;I say common people with the
deepest respect for the term&mdash;than this girl is conscious
of the gulf between herself and the class to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
which her grandparents belonged. The young
man&#8217;s story was the same <i>da capo</i>, except that he
was given a boy&#8217;s luxuries instead of a girl&#8217;s. It
has been carefully concealed from them by their
parents that their grandparents swept, dusted,
chopped wood, traded at country stores, and did
all those plain but useful and respectable things
which made their fortune. To hear them talk about
&#8216;grandmamma&#8217; and &#8216;grandpapa&#8217; is the very essence
of simplicity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet those people constitute the most exclusive
set in Washington,&#8221; said Crane, angrily, as if
thereby some wrong was inflicted on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; replied Thorndyke. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see
that the first result of their prosperity in their own
community was to segregate them from their less
fortunate friends and neighbours? Don&#8217;t you see
how inevitably it came about that their children
were separated from their neighbours&#8217; children?
And in the end they were drawn from the Circlevilles
and the Meekins&#8217;s Cross Roads by sheer necessity?
They became fugitives, as it were, from
their own class, and how natural it was for them to
be afraid of their own and every other class except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the recognised few, and to build up a wall around
themselves and their children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if you would dare to use that word
class on the floor of the House?&#8221; asked Crane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would dare to but I shouldn&#8217;t care to,&#8221; answered
Thorndyke. &#8220;One reason why I have so little
to say on the floor of the House is because it involves
many explanations to men who know just as
well what you mean as you do, and agree with you
thoroughly. But there&#8217;s Buncombe County to be
considered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At all events,&#8221; said Crane, returning to himself
as a subject of consideration, &#8220;this social side of
life appeals to me powerfully&mdash;too powerfully, I
am afraid. I feel an odd sort of kinship with those
old ladies of seventy that I see going the rounds in
Paris gowns and high-heeled shoes, with their scanty
white hair crimped and curled within an inch of
their lives. It&#8217;s serious business with them; and,
by George, it&#8217;s serious with me, too. Of course I
am a blamed fool for acknowledging so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least. But you must know that it
can only be a pastime with you. There is Circleville,
and Annette, and the babies&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Thorndyke saw Crane&#8217;s face grow a little pale,
and he fell silent for a minute or two, and while
Thorndyke was watching the current of his
thought, as revealed by a singularly expressive and
untrained countenance, Crane burst out:</p>

<p>&#8220;The best in the way of women I&#8217;ve seen yet is
Constance Maitland&mdash;I wonder why she never married.
She&#8217;s nearer forty than thirty; that she told
me herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now Thorndyke&#8217;s turn to grow pale.
Constance Maitland was responsible to a great degree
for most that had happened to him for the last
eighteen years, and in all that time he had not seen
her once; but the mere mention of her name was
enough to agitate him; and she was in Washington
and he had not known it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was a minute or two before he recovered himself
and began to pull at the cigar in his mouth.
Then he saw by Crane&#8217;s face that Constance Maitland
was something to him, too. Had the poor devil
fallen in love with her as he had with Washington
dinners? Thorndyke was disgusted with his friend,
and showed it by saying, coldly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew Miss Maitland well some years ago. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
is very charming. But, Crane, it&#8217;s bad manners to
call ladies by their first names.&#8221; Thorndyke used
the old-fashioned word &#8220;ladies&#8221; where the moderns
say &#8220;women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane coloured furiously. He did not mind in
the least being coached in legislative affairs, but he
winced at being taught manners. However, he had
the highest admiration for Thorndyke&#8217;s manners,
so he replied, carelessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I accept the amendment. As you say, Con&mdash;Miss
Maitland is very charming, and has been
charming men for the past twenty years. Now, in
Circleville she would have been called an old maid
ten years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, of course, she had always had a train of men
after her, and the fact that she remained unmarried
showed either that she had no heart&mdash;or&mdash;sometimes
a wild thought had crossed Thorndyke&#8217;s
mind&mdash;suppose Constance Maitland still remembered
him? This thought, coming into his head,
set his heart to pounding like a steam-engine while
Crane talked on.</p>

<p>&#8220;That woman epitomises the charm of Washington
life to me. First, she is unlike any woman I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
ever saw before; that is in itself a charm. Then,
she has an environment; that, too, is new to me. I
went to see her four times last winter.&#8221; Then he
mentioned where she lived. &#8220;Her parlour&mdash;I mean
drawing-room&mdash;was nothing compared with the
others I&#8217;d been in here, but it was distinctive. It
wasn&#8217;t furnished from bric-&agrave;-brac shops and art-sale
catalogues. All the antiques came from her
own family&mdash;all the miniatures and portraits were
her own kinsfolk. And, after having lived in Europe
for twenty years, as she told me&mdash;because she
doesn&#8217;t mind mentioning dates&mdash;and having seen
more of European society than one American woman
in ten thousand, she loves and admires her own
country, and came back here to live the first minute
she was free. That struck me all of a heap, because,
though you wouldn&#8217;t judge so from my
Fourth of July speeches at Circleville, I should
think that Europe would be something between
Washington and Paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t been there yet,&#8221; was Thorndyke&#8217;s
response to this. And then Crane proceeded to tell
a story which Thorndyke knew by heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems, so I heard from other people, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
was brought up by an old crank of an aunt,
who had married a Baron Somebody-or-other in
Germany. This old feminine party tried to make
Constance marry some foreign guy, and when she
wouldn&#8217;t, the old lady, in a rage, made a will, giving
all she had to Constance on condition that she
did not marry an American. It was thought the
old lady wasn&#8217;t exactly in earnest, but unluckily
she died the week after, and so the will stands&mdash;and
that&#8217;s why Con&mdash;Miss Maitland never married,
I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a band came blaring down the street,
followed by the usual crowd of negroes, dancing,
shouting, and grimacing along the sidewalk, and
looking weird in the high lights and black shadows
of the night. Crane, to whom the negroes had never
ceased to be a raree show, got up and went to
the window, whistling the air the band played;
meanwhile Thorndyke lay back in his chair trying
to get used to the knowledge that Constance Maitland
had been in Washington months and he had
not known it. There was a prologue to the story
just told by Crane&mdash;and Crane had no suspicion
of this prologue. A young American of good birth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
but slender fortune&mdash;himself, in fact&mdash;was the primary
cause of the old Baroness von Hesselt&#8217;s remarkable
will. It was he whom the old lady held
responsible for Constance Maitland&#8217;s flat refusal
to marry the son of an imperial privy councillor
with seven points to his coronet. Oh, those days at
the Villa Flora on Lake Como&mdash;those days that
come only in youth, when the whole world seems
young! When, from the terrace, Constance and
himself watched the sunset trembling in the blue
lake and making another heaven there! And those
starlit nights when Constance and himself were in
a boat alone together, and she sang to her guitar
for him, and he repeated verses from Childe Harold
to her! They were both young and singularly innocent,
and were deeply in love&mdash;of that Thorndyke
could never doubt; and because they were
young and innocent and in love with each other
the old Baroness thought them the wickedest and
most designing creatures on earth. She had spent
all her life in Europe, had frankly married for a
title, and wished Constance to do the same. The
old Baron, a helpless invalid, was not reckoned
in the equation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>The Baroness von Hesselt had acquired what
many Americans who live abroad acquire&mdash;a spite
against her own country. This was accentuated
by the fact that she was a Southerner of the old
r&eacute;gime, who hated liberty, equality, and fraternity
from the bottom of her heart, and who instinctively
realised her unfitness for America. She had also
forgotten a good deal about it, and thought a very
effective way to keep Constance from marrying
Thorndyke or any other American was to cut her off
from a fortune in that event. The will was made,
and the old Baroness proclaimed it loudly for a
week. At the end of that time the gentleman on the
pale horse unexpectedly summoned her. There was
but one thing for any man to do in Geoffrey Thorndyke&#8217;s
circumstances, and that was, to go far away
from Constance Maitland. No definite words or
promises had passed between them, but unless eyes
and tones of the voice, and all sweet, unutterable
things are liars, they were pledged to one another.</p>

<p>Thorndyke, being in those days a very human
youngster, hoped that Constance would send him
a line&mdash;a word&mdash;and doubted not for a moment
that his love would make up to her for a fortune.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
But no line or word ever came. As years went on
Thorndyke reached the sad knowledge that modern
life requires something more than bread and cheese
and kisses, and felt a sense of relief that it had not
been in his power to take Constance Maitland&#8217;s fortune
from her with only love to give in return. But
this knowledge did not make him content. On the
contrary, year by year had her memory become more
poignant to him. It was that which had made him
throw himself with all his being and equipment into
public life. It was that which made him tender
to all innocent, sweet women like Annette Crane&mdash;innocent,
sweet women brought back to him something
of his lost love. He knew she had never married,
but all else concerning her was a blank to him.
He was consumed with a desire to ask Crane something
about her&mdash;all about her&mdash;but he had noted
instantly that in Crane&#8217;s eye and voice was a manner
which revealed a dangerous interest in Constance
Maitland; and Thorndyke was held back
and urged forward to speak of her.</p>

<p>The band passed on, the street once more grew
quiet, and Crane returned to his seat. Thorndyke
smoked savagely to keep from mentioning Constance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Maitland&#8217;s name. Crane did likewise with
the same motive, but having less self-control than
Thorndyke he could not but hark back to the ticklish
subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you say you knew Miss Maitland?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. A long time ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s very old-fashioned; enough so to stay
out of society when she is wearing mourning. She&#8217;s
been in mourning for her uncle by marriage ever
since she&#8217;s been in Washington&mdash;six months. The
exclusives don&#8217;t stay in mourning more than six
months for husbands, wives, or children. Parents
and aunts and uncles don&#8217;t count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The exclusives don&#8217;t have any aunts and uncles,&#8221;
Thorndyke put in shortly. &#8220;They have
nieces and nephews who are presentable after they
have been washed and combed&mdash;but they can&#8217;t go
back as far as uncles and aunts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they can&#8217;t. Their uncles and aunts are just
like <i>my</i> uncles and aunts. Well, I gather that the
old Baron for whom Miss Maitland has worn
mourning wasn&#8217;t a bad old party&mdash;better, perhaps,
than his American wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was,&#8221; said Thorndyke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Crane looked at him suspiciously and then kept
on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Maitland is going out this spring. She
says I&#8217;m quite right in thinking there is a delightful
society attainable here in Washington, but she&#8217;s
so pleased to be back in her own country that she
praises everything right and left. She doesn&#8217;t
even mind the Dupont statue, and won&#8217;t discuss the
Pension building. To see her flow of spirits you
would think her the happiest woman in the world.
Yet she told me once that she wasn&#8217;t really happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All women tell you that before you get through
with them,&#8221; growled Thorndyke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Annette never has,&#8221; said Crane, rising and
throwing away his cigar. &#8220;Some time, if you wish
to call on Miss Maitland, I&#8217;ll take you round.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorndyke restrained the temptation to brain
Crane with the carafe on the table by him, partly
out of regard for himself, partly out of regard to
Crane, and partly from the fact that Crane was a
much bigger man than he was. But his colleague
was evidently quite unconscious of Thorndyke&#8217;s
bloody inclinations, and thought himself the best
fellow in the world to be willing to give Thorndyke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
a view into the paradise of Constance Maitland&#8217;s
company.</p>

<p>&#8220;And as for my streak of luck, as you call it, I
intend to devote all my powers to my work, so that
no matter what other committee makes a fool of
itself, the Committee on Foreign Affairs won&#8217;t&mdash;at
least through its chairman,&#8221; Crane continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy enough to steer that committee when
everything is peaceful,&#8221; answered Thorndyke,
meaning to take the new chairman down a peg.
&#8220;And it&#8217;s a great deal easier when we get into a continental
mess as we are now. Wait until you get
on the Ways and Means, or Committee on Elections,
or Banking and Currency, if you want to have a
little Gehenna of your own on earth. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorndyke sat up smoking until after two
o&#8217;clock. His thoughts were not concerned with
Crane&#8217;s political future, nor with his own either,
nor with the continental mess. He was thinking
about that dead-and-gone time, and how far away it
was; the moderns did not make love through the
medium of sentimental songs to the guitar and to
stanzas from Childe Harold. They preferred
ragtime on the mandolin and the Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t of Omar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Khayy&aacute;m; and they no longer seemed to fall in
love in the painful and whole-souled manner which
had befallen him; and then he wandered off into
thinking how a man&#8217;s will could go so far and no
farther, and how he should feel when he saw Constance
Maitland, as he must eventually, and how
she would look and speak. He concluded, before
he went to bed, that he had experienced that unlucky
accident, the breaking of heart, which would
not mend, do what he could; for he was one of those
rare and unfortunate men who can love but once.</p>

<small>THE RISE OF A PREMIER AND SOMETHING ABOUT
TWO HEARTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>On the fifteenth of April Congress met for one of
the most exciting sessions in the history of the country.
There was excitement both for the members
and for the public. Usually, when great economic
questions have to be disposed of, which rack the intelligence
of the strongest men in the House and
Senate, which make and unmake Presidents and
policies, at which men work like slaves toiling at
the oar, by night as well as by day, and of which
the harvest of death is grimly reckoned beforehand,
the people go on quietly, reading with calm indifference
the proceedings of Congress in the newspapers
or skipping them because of their dulness.
When questions affecting the honour and prestige
of the country arise, the American people, justly
described as &#8220;strong, resolute, and ofttimes violent,&#8221;
become deeply agitated, are swayed all one way by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the same mighty impulse, and force Congress to
act as the people wish. The Congress at these times
is calm. There is nothing to do but comply with
the mandates of the people. One party is as willing
to vote supplies as another. All march together.
The march would become a wild storming
party but for a few cool heads and obstructives,
who act as a brake, and keep the pace down to something
reasonable and the policies in the middle of
the road. But the brake is powerless to stop the
march onward.</p>

<p>At this session, though, there were to be things
to agitate both the people and the Congress. The
question of peace or war had to be decided; and if
it were peace, as the cooler heads foresaw, it would
be peace on such stupendous terms of power and
prestige to this country that it might be impossible
to deal sanely with the great economic
problems which were like the rumblings of an
earthquake, and were liable to produce vast convulsions.
For the present, however, economic questions
were in the background, the Committee on
Foreign Affairs was the most prominent one in
the House.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>It almost cured Crane of his infatuation for
Washington society to see how little it was impressed
by the large events waiting to burst from
under the great white dome on the hill. Himself,
in a fever heat of suppressed excitement, he felt
aggrieved that dinners still went on unflaggingly,
that the first long season of grand opera Washington
had ever known was about to begin, and claimed
much attention. None of these smart people seemed
to care in the least that he was to present the report
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in an unprecedentedly
short time&mdash;a report which might
mean war or peace. He expressed his sense of personal
injury to Thorndyke as the two sat hard at
work in their committee-room one night a week
after the meeting of Congress.</p>

<p>They were quite alone, and it might be said that
the report was theirs alone. There were other
strong men on the committee, but they had got
used to the autocratic rule of Thorndyke, and
rather liked it. He consulted them attentively, but
he was always the man who acted. The new chairman
recognised this, and being ambitious to rule
as Thorndyke had ruled, he consulted his predecessor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
somewhat ostentatiously&mdash;at which his colleagues
smiled and let him alone. Crane had just
experienced an instance of Thorndyke&#8217;s goodwill,
who was in the act of saving his chairman from
making a ridiculous blunder which would have hindered
his prospects very much as Oliver Goldsmith&#8217;s
unlucky red coat did for him with the Bishop.
The Secretary of State, a very long-headed
person in a small way, had previously got the
length of the Honourable Julian Crane&#8217;s foot, as
the vulgar express it. He had asked Crane to play
golf with him; he had invited the member from Circleville
to little dinners with him. The Secretary&#8217;s
wife had requested Crane as a great favour to assist
her widowed daughter in chaperoning a party of
d&eacute;butantes and college youths to the theatre, and
when a scurrilous journal had reflected grossly
upon himself, a married man, and the young widow,
Crane was in secret hugely flattered. To be linked,
even remotely, in a scandal with the daughter of
the Secretary of State was a social rise&mdash;although
he happened to know that Cap&#8217;n Josh Slater, the
father of the Secretary of State, had been engaged
in steam-boating on the Ohio River in the wild forties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
with his own grandfather, Cap&#8217;n Ebenezer
Crane. The Secretary&#8217;s father had made money,
and his daughters were replicas of Lady Clara Vere
de Vere. Of his sons, one, the present Secretary of
State, had left the banks of the Ohio never to return,
and by a steady evolution had passed from the
Western Reserve College to Harvard, thence to Oxford
for a post-graduate course, to Berlin as attach&eacute;
to the then Legation, thence home to exercise
a gift the politicians had found in him, viz., the
power to form a silk-stocking contingent in the
party to offset the silk stockings in the opposition.
Being a man of some brains and much perseverance,
he had reached the most highly ornamental position
in the Government of the United States&mdash;the Secretaryship
of State. He maintained it with dignity.
He had, of course, long since, abjured the
Methodist faith, in which he was reared, and was
as uncompromising a Churchman as his brother, the
Episcopal Bishop&mdash;for such had been the career of
the steam-boat captain&#8217;s other son. Both had been
brought up in an auriferous atmosphere totally
denied the descendants of Cap&#8217;n Ebenezer Crane,
who had lost his all in the steam-boat business, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
spent his last years keeping the Circleville tavern.
Crane knew all about this, one of his grandfather&#8217;s
standing quarrels with Fate being that Josh Slater,
a durned fool, and a rascal besides, in Cap&#8217;n Ebenezer&#8217;s
opinion, had made so much, where a better
man&mdash;that is, himself&mdash;couldn&#8217;t make a living.
But Crane knew better than to refer to any of these
matters before the Secretary, who was indeed only
dimly acquainted with his father&#8217;s profession. The
Secretary, a polished, scholarly man, was a very
good imitation of a statesman. He liked to be
called the Premier, prided himself on his resemblance
to Lord Salisbury, and dressed the part to
perfection. During Thorndyke&#8217;s chairmanship of
the Committee on Foreign Affairs, when the present
international complication had been brewing,
the Secretary had been a good deal annoyed by being
sent for to the Capitol on what he considered
flimsy pretexts. He determined when Crane succeeded
Thorndyke to make a bold stroke, and have
the chairman come to him occasionally, on the sly,
as it were. To this end he had written Crane a little
note beginning, &#8220;My Dear Crane.&#8221; In it the Secretary
spoke pathetically of his lumbago, also of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
his age&mdash;sixty-one&mdash;and would Crane, on the score
of old friendship and the Secretary&#8217;s many infirmities,
come to see him at a certain hour at the Department,
and perhaps the necessity might be
avoided of the Secretary taking a trip in the
changeable weather to the Capitol, which otherwise
would be inevitable.</p>

<p>Crane showed this note with ill-concealed pride,
and was about to fall into the Secretary&#8217;s little
trap through the telephone when Thorndyke hastily
interposed:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; said he, grinning, &#8220;you had
better wait until the Secretary&#8217;s lumbago gets better,
rather than inaugurate the policy of running
up to the State Department to see him, when it is
his business to come here to see you. The old fellow
tried that game on me, but, in return, I used to get
the committee to invite him down here about once a
week to give his views on something or other for
which we didn&#8217;t give a tinker&#8217;s damn, as the Duke
of Wellington used to say. But it cured him. He
stopped inviting me cordially and informally to
come to the State Department to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane&#8217;s face flushed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>&#8220;The d&mdash;&mdash;d old sneak!&#8221; he yelled&mdash;and then
dashed off a curt note to the Secretary. Thorndyke
promptly confiscated this note, and dictated
another, which was, if anything, more affectionate
in tone than the Secretary&#8217;s. Crane would wish,
above all things, to oblige the Secretary, but was
himself under the weather, and so forth, and so
forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I played golf with him at seven o&#8217;clock
this morning!&#8221; cried Crane, throwing down his
pen.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better,&#8221; replied Thorndyke. &#8220;You
are returning his own lie to him with interest. Go
on&mdash;&#8216;Possibly by to-morrow you may be well
enough to comply with the wish of the committee,
and come to the Capitol. In any event, before a
formal request is made for your attendance, your
convenience will be consulted with regard to the
hours and the weather.&#8217; And when you get him up
here put him in the sweat-box and give him all
that&#8217;s coming to him&mdash;that&#8217;s the way to get on with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Crane, light breaking upon him,
&#8220;and when you had the old fellow up here, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
thought you were so friendly and polite to him, you
were just &#8216;sweating&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I was doing. However, I reckon
the present Secretary to be the ideal man for the
place. He is highly ornamental, perfectly honest,
and satisfied with the shadow of power. Occasionally
he reaches out for something in the way of etiquette
or attention, as in the present case, but
when he doesn&#8217;t get it he subsides quietly. The
State Department has been steadily losing power
and prestige from the foundation of the government
until now, when it is recognised as a mere
clerical bureau and a useful social adjunct to the
Administration. Do you think if Daniel Webster
were alive to-day he would take the portfolio of
State? He would see the Administration at the
demnition bow-wows first. Mr. Blaine took it twice
under compulsion, and was the most wretched and
restless man on earth while he had it. Both times
he was so much too big for the place that he became
exceedingly dangerous, and had to be forced out
each time to save the Administration from total
wreck. The lesson has not been lost on succeeding
Presidents, and there will be no more Blaines and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Websters in the State Department. The trouble
is, however, that foreign Chancelleries persist in
taking the State Department seriously. They
can&#8217;t take in that you, as chairman of the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs, are of a good deal
more consequence at present than the Secretary of
State. You can send for him, but he can&#8217;t send for
you. You can call for information from him and
practically force him to give it to you, but he can&#8217;t
make you tell the day of the week unless you want
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane, who had signed and sealed his note while
Thorndyke was speaking, glowed with pleasure at
the last words. But he returned to his grievance
about none of the smart set taking any particular
interest in what was going to happen on the morrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;The diplomatic people are taking the deepest
interest in it,&#8221; replied Thorndyke, grimly, &#8220;and
when this report is read to-morrow they will be up
against a fierce proposition.&#8221; Thorndyke was not
above using slang when in the company of men
alone.</p>

<p>They fell to work again at some last details, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
it was not far from midnight when they left the
great white building on the hill. In spite of the engrossing
matters which had employed them, both
men had been haunted by the recollection of their
conversation the night before, about Constance
Maitland&mdash;but neither had spoken her name.
Thorndyke said, as they came out on the deserted
moonlit plaza:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity Mrs. Crane can&#8217;t be here to listen to
you speak to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Crane, promptly. &#8220;But I have
written her about it, and I shall send her a despatch
as soon as I get through to-morrow. By the way,
I sent Miss Maitland a ticket to the reserved gallery.
I shall probably see her at the French Embassy,
where I am going to take a look at the ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Crane&#8217;s first invitation to the French Embassy,
and he was slightly elated at it, and being
unable to conceal anything, Thorndyke saw his elation.
His only reply to Crane&#8217;s important communication
was, &#8220;Good-night&mdash;here&#8217;s my car.&#8221; And
he jumped aboard the trailer just passing.</p>

<p>When he reached his own door he turned away
from it. The night was growing more enchantingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
lovely every hour. A great white April moon
was riding high in the heavens, and the soft freshness
of the spring night was in the air. Thorndyke
made the beauty of the night an excuse to himself
for remaining out of doors. In truth, he had felt
a yearning, ever since Crane had first told him that
Constance Maitland was in Washington, to see her
habitation&mdash;it was next to seeing her. He struggled
against it for an hour or two, walking away
from the street wherein she dwelt. He soon found
himself in the poorer part of Washington, a long
way from the gay quarters; a part of narrow brick
or frame houses, cheap churches, and many small
shops. He was reminded of that saying, as old as
Plato, who did not himself say it first: &#8220;In all cities
there are two cities&mdash;the city of the poor and the
city of the rich.&#8221; The city of the poor in Washington,
however, is the least disheartening of its
sort in the world&mdash;for even the poorest house has
air and space and sunlight about it and green trees
to shelter it.</p>

<p>After having wandered about until he felt
certain the West End was asleep, Thorndyke
yielded to the overmastering impulse and set out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
for his goal at the other end of the town. He soon
entered Massachusetts Avenue&mdash;that long and
beautiful avenue, shaded with double rows of lindens,
their pale green buds breaking out into their
first delicate leaf, the vista broken by open spaces
with statues, and closing with the rich foliage of
Dupont Circle. All was quiet, silent, and more and
more brightly moonlit. No glaring gas lamps
marred the light or darkness of the perfect night&mdash;for
in Washington when the moon shines the gas
lamps don&#8217;t shine.</p>

<p>Thorndyke&#8217;s soul, dragging his unwilling feet,
brought him to one of the pretty side streets opening
upon the splendid avenue. It was here that
Constance Maitland&#8217;s house was.</p>

<p>Thorndyke believed&mdash;such is the folly of love&mdash;he
would have known the house even if Crane had
not mentioned the number. But the number was
conclusive. It was an old-fashioned house, broad
and low for a city house. It had been the advance
guard of fashion. There was a little strip of garden
and shrubbery at the side, where clipped cedars
were formally set, and three great lilac-bushes were
hastening into a bloom of purple splendour. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
scent of the lilacs brought back the terrace on Lake
Como, where lilacs also grew, and where he and
Constance had spent those glowing and unforgotten
hours&mdash;and by moonlight they had often sung
together the old duet from Don Pasquale, &#8220;Oh,
April Night!&#8221; Thorndyke, entranced and lost in
visions, began to hum the old, old air. What
strange power of restoring the past have old songs
and the perfume of flowers long remembered!
Thorndyke felt as in a dream; all the intervening
years melted away; it was once more Como, with
its moonlight, its flower-scents, its songs, its loves&mdash;and
then he looked up and saw Constance Maitland
standing before him.</p>

<p>She had just returned from the ball&mdash;the carriage
from which she had alighted was rolling off.
As she met Thorndyke face to face on the sidewalk
she started slightly, and her long white mantle
slipped from her delicate bare shoulders to the
ground. Her eyes met Thorndyke&#8217;s&mdash;everything
was in that gaze except surprise. When two persons
think of each other daily for many years, the
strangeness is not in their meeting but in their separation.
They had seen each other last on a moonlit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
night, and the sweet scent of lilacs was in the air&mdash;and
now, after eighteen years, it was so alike!</p>

<p>The moonlight was merciful to them both.
Neither saw all of Time&#8217;s earmarks&mdash;Thorndyke
saw none at all in Constance. Her girlish figure
was quite unchanged. Her pale yellow ball-gown,
the pearls around her throat, were youthfulness itself.
She had never been remarkable for beauty,
but her face showed no lines, her silky black hair,
simply arranged, revealed none of the silver strands
that were visible by daylight. Thorndyke received
a distinct shock at her youthfulness. It was his lost
Constance of the Villa Flora.</p>

<p>She held her hand out to him without a word,
and he clasped it. In that clasp Constance realised
that she had all and more of her old power over
him. Thorndyke could not have said a word at
first to save his life, but Constance, with equal feeling,
had a woman&#8217;s glibness, and could have
plunged into commonplaces on the spot. But she
refrained, knowing that her silence was eloquent.
She withdrew her hand lingeringly. Then Thorndyke
saw the white cloak lying on the ground. He
picked it up and held it wide for Constance, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
when he enfolded her in the cloak she was enfolded
for one thrilling, perilous instant in his arms. Another
moment and she would be at his mercy. Constance,
knowing this, and suddenly remembering the
maid waiting for her, and possibly belated neighbours
looking out of their windows, withdrew a little.
This restored Thorndyke&#8217;s vagrant senses, and
after a moment or two he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not seem&mdash;now&mdash;so long since we
parted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very long; it is nearly eighteen years,&#8221;
Constance replied. Her voice was the sweet voice
of the far South, for her young eyes had first
opened upon the blue waters of another lake than
Como&mdash;Lake Pontchartrain. In her speech there
were continual traces of her Louisiana birth&mdash;Thorndyke
had ever thought her voice and her little
mannerisms of language among her greatest
charms&mdash;and he was confirmed in his belief at the
first word she uttered. He said to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know until yesterday that you were in
Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not like to send you a card,&#8221; Constance
replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;You might have done so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know which of us is in the wrong,&#8221; she
said&mdash;said it so deliberately that it might convey
a thousand meanings. &#8220;But if you are waiting for
me to ask you&mdash;come. Of course, I cannot ask you
in now; if we were as young as we once were, it
would be quite dreadful for us to be standing and
talking as we are&mdash;but both being old enough to
take care of ourselves, we have our liberty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Love and hate are closely allied, and often reason
alike from the same premises. As Thorndyke
realised more and more that Constance Maitland
still had power to disturb him powerfully he resented
her ease and tranquillity&mdash;and aware of the
lines in his face, conscious that he was growing bald,
he felt injured at her continuing youth. Evidently,
the recollections which had made him forswear
love, forego wealth, and had turned him into
a Congressional drudge, had left no mark on her.
He took, at once, her hint to leave her, and said
stiffly:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will give me your key&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Constance handed it to him; he went up the steps
and opened the door. The gaslight fell full upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
her, and it was as if with every glance they became
more infatuated with each other and found it harder
to part.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; said Thorndyke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; to-morrow,&#8221; Constance echoed, dreamily.</p>

<p>Thorndyke banged the door to and literally ran
down the street.</p>

<p>When he came to himself, as it were, he was in
his own room, smoking. He kept on saying to himself,
&#8220;To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow,&#8221; and then called
himself a fool&mdash;a purely academic proceeding, however,
which never really influences any issue between
a man and his will. When at last he went to bed the
sky was opalescent with the coming dawn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Three</i><br />


<small>DOWN AMONG THE CAPTAINS AND THE SHOUTING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>After four hours of sleep Thorndyke waked with
the uncomfortable feeling which waits on excess in
everything, especially excess in the emotions after
one is forty years of age. The tumults of youth
are killing after forty.</p>

<p>He got through with his breakfast and his mail
under the disadvantages of seeing visions of Constance
Maitland floating all about him&mdash;visions of
Constance offering to give up her fortune and live
with him on what he could save of his Congressional
salary after supplying the wants of his crippled sister,
Elizabeth. And in case he should lose the
nomination at the hands of his boss, as he had once
done, there would be nothing at all for Constance
or Elizabeth, either, nor for himself that he could
then foresee. What a strange infatuation was Congressional
life! It was almost as strange as the infatuation
for a woman forever barred from him&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
by the worst luck in the world, he, Geoffrey
Thorndyke, was the victim of both!</p>

<p>These unpleasant thoughts walked every step of
the way with him to the Capitol on that bright
April morning. When he reached the great white
building, sitting majestically on the hill, he was one
of a vast multitude of people surging toward the
south wing. It still lacked half an hour of twelve,
and the flag was not yet hoisted. Crowds were disembarking
from the street-cars, the plaza was black
with carriages, and over all was that tension of feeling
which communicates itself to thousands and tens
of thousands of persons at once. Something was
about to happen that day in the House of Representatives.
As Crane said, the smart set cared nothing
for it, but their majesties, the people, were
deeply interested in it, and had every reason to be,
and assembled in great crowds to see the first act.
Thorndyke made his way to his committee-room.
No one was there except Crane. The gentleman
from Circleville was dressed for his first appearance
as a star. Thorndyke, being in rather a savage humour,
thought he had never seen Crane so over-dressed,
so full of elation and vain simplicity, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
in short, so nearly a fool. In this he did Crane great
injustice, for Crane never was, at any time, in the
category of fools, although he often did foolish
things.</p>

<p>He spoke to Thorndyke affably, although with a
slight air of superiority, holding in his hand the
report of which Thorndyke had supplied the most
effective part&mdash;the close reasoning, the conclusive
logic, the historical precedents, and the invincible
moderation. Thorndyke might indeed have said of
that report, as C&aelig;sar said of the Gallic wars, &#8220;All
of this I saw&mdash;most of this I was.&#8221; And in the debate
that would follow, Thorndyke would be obliged
to take care of Crane&mdash;for Crane, although a powerful
and attractive speaker, was easily disconcerted
when on his feet, and had a tendency to panic
under the enfilading fire of debate. Thorndyke was
not an orator in the popular sense, but when it came
to having all his wits about him, to defending his
position, to bold incursions into the enemy&#8217;s territory,
he was not surpassed by any man in the House.
As his colleagues said of him, he always went documented,
and carried concealed parliamentary weapons
about his person.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>By way of revenge, Thorndyke began to chaff
his colleague on the subject of his dress. Crane&#8217;s
shirt-bosom snapped like giant crackers, his cuffs
rattled, his collar creaked. He was conscious of
this, and glowered darkly at Thorndyke&#8217;s jokes.
Thorndyke&#8217;s clothes, in contradistinction to
Crane&#8217;s, were the clothes of a clothes-wearing man.
They were neither old nor new, neither out of the
fashion nor conspicuously in the fashion&mdash;they
were, in short, the clothes of a man whose father
before him had worn clothes.</p>

<p>Both men were in their seats, which were near together,
when the Speaker&#8217;s gavel fell. The galleries
were packed, the corridors jammed. In the
diplomatic gallery every seat was occupied. The
bright costumes of the Orientals and the flower-decked
spring hats of the ladies made it gay. The
gallery reserved for the President&#8217;s family and the
Cabinet families was also full. So great was the
pressure that the motion was at once made to admit
ladies to the floor of the House. They came fluttering
in like a flock of pigeons, and soon filled all the
space back of the desks. They were not, in general,
of the smart set, who, as Crane complained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
were like Gallio, and cared for none of these things&mdash;but
were chiefly of official families.</p>

<p>As soon as the prayer and some routine business
was over, the report of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs was called for. The calling of the roll
had been waived&mdash;it was easy enough to see that
every member was present who could get there, as
well as many Senators. When the report was handed
to the reading-clerk there was a deep pause.
Thorndyke looked at Crane. He was very pale, but
the veins in his neck were pulsating strongly. He
glanced up at the reserved gallery at the side, and
his face flushed deeply. Thorndyke followed his
eye. It fell upon Constance Maitland sitting in the
front row. She was dressed in a rich black toilette
which contrasted strongly with the brilliant colours
around her. A delicate black tulle hat sat upon her
graceful head, and she fanned herself slowly with a
large black fan.</p>

<p>Her distinction of appearance was extreme, and
she showed her perfect knowledge of it by the simple
but effective trick of wearing black when there
was a riot of colour around her. By means of a
good figure and perfect dressing this seduced the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
world into thinking her far handsomer than she
really was. Thorndyke recognised that when he
saw how much more attention she attracted than
much younger and more beautiful women.</p>

<p>But then the silence was broken by the great,
bell-like voice of the reading-clerk reading the report.
As the clerk proceeded, Thorndyke perceived
that the tone and manner of the report were making
a strong impression. The matter of it could not be
wholly digested, but the manner of presentation
commanded attention. Nearly every one of the
three hundred and fifty members present saw
Thorndyke&#8217;s fine Italian hand in the business&mdash;but
the crowd gazed in admiration at the tall and handsome
member from Circleville, who was reaping the
glory of the present occasion. The reading over,
Crane arose, with a few notes in his hand, prepared
to defend the report. He was a born speaker, and
as soon as he began to talk he forgot his clothes and
also made his audience forget them, too. Thorndyke
listened with enforced admiration. Crane
spoke lucidly, strongly, yet temperately&mdash;Thorndyke
had taught him the enormous power of moderation.
Thorndyke, quite unobserved, watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the faces of the European diplomats in the diplomatic
gallery, who were listening intently. One
man, whom Thorndyke reckoned the ablest diplomat
among those representing Western Europe, stealthily
took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead.
An Ambassadress dropped her card-case at
his feet and he did not see it. Another, a round,
red-faced, sensible, guileless man, looked about him
with a frankly puzzled air, which said as plainly as
words, &#8220;God bless my soul&mdash;what are we to do about
this?&#8221; The younger men unconsciously assumed
expressions of contempt, indifference, and displeasure.
They had every reason to be displeased at the
turn international affairs were taking&mdash;and there
was no alternative but war.</p>

<p>Thorndyke, being experienced in legislation,
could very readily estimate the effect on his colleagues
of what Crane was saying. It was tremendous.
The vast hall was stilled, and the stillness
grew intense. By some communicable psychic force
all knew that here was a great issue met and disposed
of for a hundred years to come. To the
Americans present it was a source of pride and of
relief. The mellow, unchanging sunlight that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
glowed softly through the iridescent glass roof of
the hall fell upon their faces, serious indeed, but
steady and cheerful. The Congress was back of
that report, and the people were behind the Congress.
There was no hysteria among the Congress
or the people, but a fixed and resolute determination
which was, in effect, the registering of a decree
of fate.</p>

<p>Crane spoke for half an hour, his rich, full voice
growing richer and fuller, without becoming louder,
as he proceeded. At the very end he had allowed
himself a little leeway, rightly judging that by that
time the audience would be wrought up to the pitch
which would permit what is called eloquence. When
the last sentences, ringing with terse Americanism,
rolled out, the effect was magical. A great storm of
feeling had been evoked and had responded. The
applause was long and loud and deep and steady,
like the breaking of ocean waves upon granite
rocks. Crane&#8217;s words had pierced the heart of
every American present, and a common impulse
brought all of them to their feet. Even the Speaker,
not knowing what he was doing, rose from his
chair, then sat down again shamefacedly. None escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the tumult outwardly except the European
occupants of the diplomatic gallery. They were
ostentatiously cool, and talked and laughed during
the tempest of applause, while secretly they were
more agitated than any of the cheering multitude.
They had heard that which meant surrender to each
and all of them.</p>

<p>The Speaker&#8217;s gavel descended presently, and
quiet was partially restored. Crane was surrounded
by members of both parties congratulating him,
and he received their praise with a modesty more
sincere than was generally believed. But to him
had it been brought home that the crisis was bigger
than the man, and the people were bigger than the
crisis. Thorndyke, sitting near him, had shared in
the tempest of feeling, but a sickening disappointment
possessed him when he saw Crane&#8217;s personal
triumph. In all of Thorndyke&#8217;s years of labour
Fate had never given him any such a chance as
this. But it was his years of labour which made
Crane&#8217;s success possible. He could imagine the turgid,
strained spread-eagleism, the powerful but ill-reasoned
speech, which Crane, but for him, would
have made. His eyes, in his cold fit of chagrin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
wandered toward the place where Constance Maitland
sat. A slender black figure, gracefully holding
up the train of the black gown, was just disappearing
through the door. Thorndyke&#8217;s impulse
to follow Constance was accentuated by a strong
desire, if there should be any debate, to leave
Crane to his fate, but he soon found out that
the whole matter would go over until the next day,
and by that time his better self would assert itself,
and he would do his part&mdash;not for Crane&#8217;s sake, but
for the sake of that overmastering sense of public
duty which he cherished religiously and never alluded
to. So, finding himself free and superfluous,
he left the chamber, partly to avoid the sight of
Crane&#8217;s triumph and partly drawn by Constance
Maitland. Before leaving, however, he went up like
a gentleman and congratulated Crane, who, moved
by an honest and generous impulse, expressed the
utmost gratitude to him.</p>

<p>Out in the spring sunshine that flooded the plaza
and the parklike gardens and blazed upon the golden
dome of the fair white National Library, visible
beyond the fringe of great green trees, Thorndyke
looked about him for Constance Maitland.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
She was just stepping into a smart little brougham
with a good-looking pair of brown cobs, and drove
away toward the quiet, shady, beautiful but unfashionable
part of the town on the east.</p>

<p>The carriage went slowly, and Thorndyke, pursuing
it, saw it stop a few blocks from the Capitol,
by one of those parks large enough for one to wander
in and feel alone as if in the woods. Constance
descended from the carriage holding her skirts
daintily, and walked into the park. Thorndyke
boldly followed her&mdash;she had said to-morrow&mdash;and
this was to-morrow.</p>

<p>He came upon her in a few minutes in a little
open space, shut in, except for the pathway, by
shrubbery on every side. The grass was full of
daisies which had just put on their little white shirts
and yellow caps, and a pair of robins hopped about
with as much gayety and freedom as if they were
country robins instead of town robins.</p>

<p>Constance was sitting on a rusty iron bench, a
little in the shade. She had taken off her gloves,
and her hands, small and innocent of rings, lay in
her lap. She seemed to be day-dreaming, as if she
were eighteen instead of thirty-eight years of age.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Thorndyke was pleased to see that by the searching
light of day she did not look nearly so young
as in the mysterious night. But she was not the
less charming on that account&mdash;she had simply
reached the fulness of her development in mind, in
feeling, and even in beauty, such as hers was.</p>

<p>As Thorndyke took off his hat and bowed to her
he received a distinct invitation, by means of her
eyes and smile, to remain, so he seated himself on the
bench by her side. She began the conversation by
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just come from the House. It was very
exciting. I do not see how any one can call life in
America dull. It is Europe which is dull&mdash;it is
stagnation compared with this, our country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorndyke again noted, with delight, in her
speech that slight trace of her Creole blood which
years had not changed. She said &#8220;do not&#8221; and &#8220;can
not&#8221; in place of &#8220;don&#8217;t&#8221; and &#8220;can&#8217;t;&#8221; she took extraordinary
pains to pronounce the <i>th</i>, and had a
way of accenting last syllables in a manner not recommended
by the dictionaries. The result was piquant
and charming. Constance herself was quite
unconscious of it, and Thorndyke remembered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
in the old days he could bring her to pique and pouts
at any time by asking her to pronounce certain
words and phrases which were a perpetual stumbling-block
to her. He did not venture now to
laugh at her about this pretty idiosyncrasy, but
gravely took up the thread of conversation where
she dropped it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you think of Crane&#8217;s speech?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was quite extraordinary. But it was not like
him. It seemed to me us if he were making somebody
else&#8217;s speech. Was it yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>If Constance had searched the realms of thought
to find out the words that would most soothe and
satisfy Thorndyke at that moment she could not
have found any better than those she uttered.
Smarting under the sense of having sown for another
to reap, Thorndyke needed consolation. He
had the defects of his qualities, and along with his
passionate devotion to parliamentary life was the
natural desire for popular applause. But he had
never had it. He fondly believed that had this superb
opportunity been awarded him he should have
proved equal to it. Had it but occurred two months
earlier! He and not Crane would have been enveloped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
in trailing clouds of glory. But Constance&mdash;Constance,
with her woman&#8217;s wit, had seen that
some one else besides Crane deserved the credit for
that effort. He made no reply to her questions beyond
a slight smile, but he let it be seen that she
had hit the bull&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Crane tells me he knows you,&#8221; he said,
presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Constance. &#8220;He has been a few
times to see me. Last night I met him at the ball at
the French Embassy. I danced with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He owned up to me some time ago that he
was taking dancing-lessons&mdash;at forty-two, with a
wife and children in Circleville. I fancy his performance
answers the description that Herodotus
gives of the dancing of Hippocleides&mdash;it is diverting
to himself, but disgusting to others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, he dances very well&mdash;when he
is not trying to do his best. Perhaps you are surprised
that I should still care to dance&mdash;but remember,
pray, my mother was Creole French.&#8221;</p>

<p>And to this Thorndyke made a speech which
brought the blood into Constance Maitland&#8217;s
cheeks, knocking ten years off her age at once.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;I remember everything,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>After a moment&#8217;s pause Constance, still with a
heightened colour, continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen Mr. Crane several times this winter&mdash;not
only in my own house, but in others. Whenever
I am with him I am consumed with pity for
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not need your pity now,&#8221; said Thorndyke,
grimly. &#8220;It is more needed by his senior
Senator, who is the fly-wheel of the political machine
in his State. The old gentleman, I know, is
at this minute walking the floor in his committee-room
and gnashing his teeth over Crane&#8217;s success.
The senior Senator took Crane up, sent him to
Congress, and thought he had secured a really efficient
understrapper. I don&#8217;t think Crane will fill
that place after to-day&#8217;s triumph, and the senior
Senator knows it, and has got to discover means, if
possible, to garrote Crane politically before the next
Congressional campaign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; replied Constance, who was only interested
in the subject because she saw Thorndyke was.
&#8220;Mr. Crane, by virtue of making your speech, has
got beyond the control of his master. By the way&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
am so ignorant of Congressional matters&mdash;how
can I get the Congressional Record sent me every
day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have already got it&mdash;by mentioning to me
that you wished it. It is one of my few privileges.
I am glad to do at least that much for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorndyke heard himself saying these things
without his own volition in the least. If Constance
Maitland were willing at this moment to give up a
fortune for poverty with him, would he accept the
sacrifice? Never. How could a woman of her mature
age, nurtured in luxury, descend to poverty&mdash;for
poverty is the lot of every member of Congress
who wishes to live in something more than mere decency
on his salary. And yet Thorndyke, at every
opportunity, had assured Constance Maitland of
his unforgetting, of his tender, recollections&mdash;in
short, of his love. Nor had she showed any unwillingness
to listen. It is not a woman&#8217;s first love for
which she wrecks her life; it is her last love&mdash;that
final struggle for supremacy. There can be no
more after that. Sappho, on the great white rock
of Mitylene, knew this and perished.</p>

<p>Some thoughts like this came into Constance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Maitland&#8217;s mind, and, driving away her colour, restored
to her the lately vanished years. Silence fell
between them for a while, until Constance roused
herself, and, affecting cheerfulness, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall study the Congressional Record with interest.
Everything in one&#8217;s own country is of interest
after a long and painful exile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should read Lord Bolingbroke&#8217;s defence of
exile,&#8221; replied Thomdyke, moving a little nearer to
her, and resting his elbow on the back of the bench
so that he could look into her pensive, changing
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, I daresay, Lord Bolingbroke pined in
his exile. Nobody believed him when he said he did
not mind. Mine, however, was complete. My
uncle, von Hesselt, who was an honourable man in
his way, thought he was carrying out my aunt&#8217;s
wishes by keeping me wholly away from all Americans
and wholly with foreigners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you could have left him after you were of
age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you do not know! He was the most terrible
sufferer you can imagine, for fifteen years. And
what was worse, he was surrounded by people, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
own relatives, who, I truly believe, would have shortened
his life if they could. He knew this, and
feared it even more than was reasonable. Once, my
longing for my country grew such that it overcame
me, and I told my uncle I must, I must come
to America. He pleaded with me&mdash;imagine an old
man, whose life was one long stretch of pain and
fear, pleading with you until he fell prone in a
paroxysm of despair! I, too, was in despair, and
I promised him I would remain with him during his
life.&mdash;I hardly knew what I was saying&mdash;I was not
twenty-one at the time&mdash;but I knew well enough
after it was said. I kept my word, and I nursed him
through his last illness and closed his eyes in death.
Then, as soon as all was over, I sailed for America.
I feel now as if I never wished to see Europe again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did Baron von Hesselt realise the enormous
sacrifice you made for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that is, partly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your aunt certainly was most unjust to you,&#8221;
said Thorndyke, coolly. &#8220;I mean, that provision
robbing you of all your fortune in case you marry
an American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, very unjust,&#8221; replied Constance, with equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
coolness, although the flush returned to her
cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&mdash;I was to blame for that,&#8221; cried Thorndyke,
venturing farther upon ticklish ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not altogether,&#8221; replied Constance, maintaining
the steadiness of her voice. &#8220;My aunt hated
our country; she could not forget the Civil War;
and she meant&mdash;poor soul, I forgive her now&mdash;that
I should never return to America permanently.
It was a strange thing to do, but I must admit
my aunt to have been in some respects both a strange
and a foolish woman. Let us not speak of her
again. I am back, and if I feel as I do now I shall
never live in Europe again. It is time for me to
prepare to grow old.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said this with a wan little smile, and all at
once thought with terror of her age; there was but
four or five years&#8217; difference between Thorndyke
and herself, and that difference, at a certain point,
becomes transferred to the gentleman&#8217;s side of the
ledger. Suddenly the spring afternoon seemed to
become melancholy and overcast. A sharp wind
sprang up from the near-by river; the world
turned from gold to gray. At the same moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Thorndyke and Constance rose and walked away
from the spot that had been only a little while ago
so sweet and sunny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is it,&#8221; asked Constance, as they followed
the pathway leading out of the park, &#8220;a spring
morning is the merriest thing in life, and a spring
evening the saddest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should anything be sad to you, spring
evenings or any other times?&#8221; asked Thorndyke,
quietly and with perfect sincerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should any one be sad at all? Because
we are human, I suppose,&#8221; was Constance&#8217;s answer
to this.</p>

<p>As they came out upon the streets, which were
less deserted than usual, Thorndyke looked toward
the south wing of the Capitol. The flag was fluttering
down from its flag-staff.</p>

<p>&#8220;The House has adjourned,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and some
history has been made to-day&mdash;likewise a great reputation
for our friend Crane.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brougham was driving up and down, and the
coachman, perceiving the graceful black figure on
the sidewalk, drove toward them. Thorndyke
noted, with disgust, the elegance of the turnout&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
two perfectly matched cobs, the silver-mounted
harness of Spanish leather, the miniature brougham
with &#8220;C. M.&#8221; in cipher on the panels&mdash;the whole
must have cost about half his yearly income. This,
together with Crane&#8217;s remarkable triumph, made
him surly, and he said, stiffly, as he assisted Constance
into the brougham:</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave me permission to call to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I withdraw it. It is now nearly three
o&#8217;clock. I have not had my luncheon, I am
tired, and I must rest this afternoon, and I go out
to dinner. To-morrow at five.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tone and manner discounted her words. It
was as if she were saying: &#8220;I must save something
for to-morrow&mdash;I will not be a spendthrift of my
joys.&#8221; Thorndyke, finding nothing to discompose
him in her words, replied, in a very good humour:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is always to-morrow&mdash;but to-morrow is better
than not at all. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brougham rolled off, and Thorndyke
stepped aboard a street-car bound for the West End.</p>

<p>At the Capitol plaza a great crowd got on,
among them the two gentlemen whom Thorndyke
affectionately described as his boss and Crane&#8217;s boss.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
The two men stood together on the platform outside.
Both of them revealed in their faces their
mastery of men and affairs, for your true boss is
necessarily a very considerable man. Senator
Standiford, Thorndyke&#8217;s boss, had an iron jaw,
which was emphasised by a low brow, but his face
was not without a touch of ideality. Senator
Bicknell, Crane&#8217;s boss, had likewise a determined
face, but his forehead and eyes betrayed the human
weakness which made him like clever men as his
instruments. Both men were millionaires. Senator
Standiford lived in three rooms at a hotel, rode in
street-cars, and gave liberally of his money to campaign
funds, charities, and his poor relations, but
was never known to part with an atom of his power
if he could help it. Senator Bicknell fared sumptuously
every day, had a splendid house and gorgeous
carriages, only rode in the street-cars for a lark,
and was reported to be a skinflint in money matters,
and somewhat foolishly lavish in giving away his
power. The two men exchanged some words which
Thorndyke, wedged inside as he was, could not but
hear. Senator Standiford was saying to his colleague:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;S. M. &amp; L. stock must be going down when <i>you</i>
ride in a street-car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I lost one of my coach-horses last night,&#8221; replied
Senator Bicknell, &#8220;and can&#8217;t use my carriage
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Misfortunes never come singly,&#8221; said Senator
Standiford, enigmatically, then adding, &#8220;I suppose
it&#8217;s in order to congratulate you on the success of
your prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Crane, to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorndyke could scarcely keep from laughing
at the look of chagrin which came over Senator
Bicknell&#8217;s countenance at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-yes,&#8221; he answered, dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get in a panic,&#8221; kept on Senator Standiford,
with rude good humour; &#8220;I know how it is
with those fellows. Crane thinks from this day
forth that you are a back number, an old fogy,
and a dead cock in the pit. He will go into what he
considers a grooming process for the next four
years&mdash;oh, I know those fellows! He will kick up
a lot of dust in the gubernatorial convention, will
make a great display of not wanting the nomination,
and will bide his time until your term expires.
Then he will find it is a grueling and not a grooming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
he has had, and he will get a small bunch of
votes, but I don&#8217;t think you need take the fellow
seriously just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this last sentence Senator Bicknell&#8217;s face shone
like the sun. It shone the more when Senator
Standiford kept on:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to fear a man who makes a
good speech&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in no fear of any one,&#8221; gravely replied
Senator Bicknell, who thought it essential to his
dignity to say so much.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the strong debater who is likely to become
formidable. There&#8217;s Thorndyke now&mdash;Crane has
made the speech&mdash;largely Thorndyke&#8217;s&mdash;but he is
totally unequal to the running fire of debate.
Thorndyke could do him up inside of ten minutes.
Luckily for him, the debate will not be fierce, and
Thorndyke will really conduct it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thorndyke is a very able man,&#8221; said Senator
Bicknell, as if thinking aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but totally without ambition,&#8221; replied
Senator Standiford, gravely, and Thorndyke,
within the car, laughed silently.</p>

<p>It was, however, no laughing matter, but Thorndyke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
having chosen his r&ocirc;le for better or for worse,
could only cleave to it, forsaking all others. However,
he would see Constance Maitland the next day
at five o&#8217;clock. There was balm in Gilead, or hasheesh
in the pipe, he knew not exactly which.</p>

<small>GOVERNMENT WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE
GOVERNED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Life is a battle and a march&mdash;especially public life.
Thorndyke waked the next morning prepared for
both a battle and a march. A glance at the morning
newspapers showed that the country was entirely
with the Congress, and the people, having given
their orders, would see to it that these orders were
promptly obeyed. The Continental press of Europe
with few exceptions barked furiously. The
French newspapers alone retained dignity and good
sense, pointing out the inevitable trend of events,
and advised that, instead of abusing the United
States, they should be copied in that system which
had made them great, not by war, but by peace. The
English newspapers were fair, but in some of them
bitterness was expressed at England being shouldered
out of her place as the greatest of the world-powers
by the young giant of the West. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
was in all of them, however, a note of triumph, that
this first place had been lost only to an offshoot of
the sturdy parent stock. This sentiment is often
ridiculed as a peculiarly absurd form of national
self-love, but there is, in reality, nothing ridiculous
about it. As long as self-love is a part of nations
and individuals, so long will each nation and each
individual strive to share in the general stock of
glory, achievement, and success.</p>

<p>In the American newspapers the man most
prominent was Crane. He was compared to Henry
Clay, to Stephen A. Douglas, to any and every
American public man who had early in life made
a meteoric rise in Congress. He was represented
as the embodiment of youth with the wisdom of
age. One newspaper reckoned him to be a political
Chatterton, and called him &#8220;the Wondrous Boy.&#8221;
His beauty was lauded, his voice, his delivery, the
fit of his trousers; and one enthusiastic journal in
Indianapolis promptly nominated him for the
Presidency. Thorndyke searched the newspapers
carefully, and did not find his own name once mentioned.
He reflected upon Horace Greely&#8217;s remark
that fame is a vapour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Disappointing as it was to him to feel that another
had reaped his harvest, it did not give him
acute pain; for he had waked that morning with
the agreeable consciousness which comes occasionally
to every human being, that the world is more
interesting to-day than it was yesterday; that consciousness
which illuminates the cold, gray stage of
life, and indicates that the lights are about to be
turned up and the play to begin. The kind tones
of Constance Maitland&#8217;s voice were still in Thorndyke&#8217;s
ears, and the unmistakable look of interest
in her soft eyes had visited him in dreams. He was
no nearer marrying her than he had been at any
time during the past eighteen years; the same obstacle
was there&mdash;a very large, real, terrifying, and
obvious obstacle&mdash;but there was also a sweet and
comforting suspicion in his mind that Constance,
as well as himself, had cherished the idyl of their
youth. And then, by daylight, she did not look so
preposterously girlish as she had looked by moonlight
and in ball-dress. This gave Thorndyke considerable
pleasure as he brushed the remnants of his
hair into positions where they would do the most
good. Her apparent advantage of him in the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
of youth and good looks had been disturbing to
him at first. She still had much of youth and
great good looks, but yet, a man with scanty hair
and a grayish moustache would not look like an old
fool beside her, as he had feared.</p>

<p>Thorndyke, according to his custom, walked to
the Capitol. The morning, like most spring mornings
in Washington, was as beautiful as the first
morning in the garden of Eden. He chose unfrequented
streets, and, passing under the long green
arcades, had only the trees for his companionship
on his walk.</p>

<p>Instead of reaching the building by way of the
plaza, Thorndyke chose rather to ascend the long
flights of steps leading upward from terrace to terrace
on the west front. It is a way little used, but
singularly beautiful, with its marble balustrades, its
lush greenness of shrubbery, and the noble view both
of the building and the fair white city embosomed
in trees, spread out like a dream-city before the eye.
Half-way up Thorndyke saw Senator Standiford
sitting on one of the iron benches placed on the
falls of the terrace. Thorndyke was surprised to
see him there, and it occurred to him at once that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
it was a premeditated meeting on the Senator&#8217;s
part.</p>

<p>He was a tall, ugly old man with chin-whiskers,
but his appearance was redeemed by the power
which spoke from his strongly marked face, and
by his punctilious, old-fashioned dress and extreme
neatness. He wore a silk hat made from a block he
had used for thirty years. His coat, gray and
wide-skirted, seemed of the same vintage, and his
spotless collar of antique pattern, and his large
black silk necktie might have been worn by Daniel
Webster himself. A big pair of gold spectacles
and a gold-headed cane completed a costume which
was admirably harmonious, and produced the effect
of an old lady in 1903 with the side curls and cap
of 1853.</p>

<p>The Senator had a newspaper spread out before
him, but as Thorndyke approached folded it up,
pushed his gold spectacles up on his forehead, and
called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Have you read about the &#8216;Wondrous
Boy&#8217; this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; replied Thorndyke, smiling pleasantly
as he lifted his hat, and in response to a silent invitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
he seated himself on the bench by Standiford&#8217;s
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great speech, that,&#8221; continued the Senator.
&#8220;At first I was disposed to give you the credit for
all of it&mdash;but there&#8217;s something in that fellow
Crane. You couldn&#8217;t have coached him so well if
he hadn&#8217;t been capable of learning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do me too much honour,&#8221; replied Thorndyke,
laughing, but with something like bitterness.</p>

<p>Senator Standiford continued with a dry contortion
of the lips which was meant for a smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll see, my son, that your friend Crane
won&#8217;t grow quite so fast as he thinks he will. In
our times public men require the seasoning of experience
before they amount to anything. There&#8217;ll be
no more Henry Clays elected to the House of Representatives
before they are thirty. The world was
young, then, but we have matured rapidly. It is
true that we have relaxed the rule of the Senate a
little, and allow the new senators to speak in the
Senate Chamber at a much earlier period in their
senatorial service than formerly. But speech-making
is a dangerous pastime. Much of the small success
I have achieved&#8221;&mdash;here Senator Standiford&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
face assumed a peculiar expression of solemnity
which made him look like a deacon handing around
the church plate&mdash;&#8220;I lay to the fact that I never
could make a speech in my life, and I found it out
at an early stage in my career. I&#8217;m a Presbyterian,
as you know, but in my town I&#8217;m classed as a heretic
and an iconoclast, because when they want to
call a new preacher and to have him preach a specimen
sermon I always tell the elders, &#8216;Why do you
want to judge the fellow by the way he talks? It&#8217;s
the poorest test in the world to apply to a man.
Find out what he can <i>do</i>.&#8217; But they won&#8217;t listen to
me, of course, and the Fourth Presbyterian Church
is perennially filled by a human wind-bag, who
snorts and puffs and blows dust about until the
congregation get tired of him and try another wind-bag.
In Congress wind-bags don&#8217;t last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same, I wish from the bottom of my
heart that I had had Crane&#8217;s chance yesterday and
had used it as well,&#8221; replied Thorndyke.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had you would have given our junior
Senator a bad quarter of an hour,&#8221; replied Senator
Standiford, gravely.</p>

<p>Now, in common with all true Senatorial bosses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Standiford had seen to it that his junior Senator
was a man of straw, put in the place in order that
the boss might have two votes in the Senate. Never
had the junior Senator yet voted or acted in opposition
to his master; but had Thorndyke been the
junior it would have been another story, and both
men knew it. This caused Thorndyke to remark,
coolly:</p>

<p>&#8220;He would have no reason to disturb himself&mdash;the
ass! You have been kind enough to give me to
understand that I am ineligible for promotion,
not being made of putty, as our junior Senator
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now!&#8221; remonstrated Senator Standiford,
again assuming his air of a seventeenth-century
Puritan. &#8220;To hear you anybody would think that
our State organisation didn&#8217;t want every first-class
man it can get! We have the highest regard
for your services, and we do what we can to keep
you in your present place because we see your usefulness
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Senator Standiford punctiliously used the euphemism
&#8220;we&#8221; just as he gravely consulted all the
pothouse politicians and heelers in &#8220;the organisation,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
but it did not materially affect the fact that
he was the whole proposition in his own State.</p>

<p>Thorndyke looked full into the deep, calm eyes
of the rugged old man before him, and could not
forbear laughing; but there was not the glimmer
of a twinkle in them. Presently the old man said,
coolly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I should tell you that I may retire at
the end of my term, two years from now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should wish to believe anything you say, my
dear Senator, but I am afraid I couldn&#8217;t believe
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fellow you are! But let me tell you&mdash;mind,
this is a confidence between gentlemen&mdash;my
retirement is not impossible. You know my daughter,
my little Letty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>As Senator Standiford spoke the name his face
softened, and a passion of parental love shone in
his deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a very remarkable girl, Mr. Thorndyke,
very remarkable; and she loves her old father
better than he deserves. I have as good sons as
any man ever had&mdash;but that daughter left me by
my dead wife is worth to me everything else on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
God&#8217;s earth. The doctors have been frightening
her about me lately. They tell her I work too hard
for my time of life&mdash;that I ought to take a rest,
and if I will do it I can add ten years to my life.
Now, you know, the State organisation will never
let me take a rest&#8221;&mdash;Senator Standiford said this
quite seriously&mdash;&#8220;and Letty as good as told me six
months ago that if I should be re-elected to the Senate&#8221;&mdash;the
Senator uttered this &#8220;if&#8221; in a tone of the
most modest deprecation&mdash;&#8220;<i>if</i> I should be re-elected
for another term&mdash;as she wishes me to be&mdash;then she
wants me to resign. I don&#8217;t mind admitting that
if any other human being had said this to me except
my daughter Letty, I should have reckoned myself
drunk or crazy to have listened to it. But my
daughter, as I mentioned to you, is a remarkable
girl. Besides, the child is not strong herself, and
if she gets to worrying about me&mdash;well, you can
see, Mr. Thorndyke, how it is with me. The world
credits me with loving place and power above everything
on earth, but there is something dearer to me
than the office of President of the United States:
it is my daughter. And the sweetness and the tenderness
of that child for her old father&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Here Senator Standiford took out a large red
silk handkerchief and blew a blast like the blast of
Roncesvalles.</p>

<p>Being an accomplished judge of men, Senator
Standiford, while speaking, had watched Thorndyke
closely. Had he shown any undue elation over
the political prospects indicated by Senator Standiford&#8217;s
possible retirement, Thorndyke&#8217;s fortunes
would have been ruined. But by the lucky accident
of having a good heart he said the most judicious
thing possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any indications of overwork in you,
Senator. At the same time I know you do the work
of ten men, and I also know the exercise of power is
so dear to you that, from the pound-master in your
own town up to the candidate for President, you
give everything your personal supervision. But as
for Miss Standiford&#8217;s not being strong&mdash;why, I
took her in to dinner less than a month ago, and remarked
on her freshness and beauty. She looked
the picture of health and ate more dinner than I
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she?&#8221; asked the Senator, anxiously. &#8220;What
did she eat?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Thorndyke did not feel in the least like laughing
at Senator Standiford&#8217;s inquiry, and answered,
promptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, everything. I remember chaffing her about
her good appetite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God! The doctors say if she can only
eat and live out in the fresh air and play golf and
ride horseback she will be all right. But, Thorndyke,
I swear to you, I am as soft as milk about
that girl. If she goes out to golf I am unhappy
for fear she will take cold. If she rides I am in terror
for fear some accident will happen to her. Ah,
Thorndyke, a man is no fit guardian for a girl like
that&mdash;the sweetest&mdash;the most affectionate&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Senator Standiford again blew his nose violently.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has always been very sweet to me,&#8221; answered
Thorndyke, &#8220;although I believe she thinks
me old enough to be her grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a very remarkable girl, sir; that I say
without the least partiality,&#8221; replied Senator
Standiford, earnestly. &#8220;She&#8217;s a little wild, having
no mother, poor child&mdash;but her heart, sir, is in the
right place. And the way she loves her old father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
is the most splendid, touching, exquisite thing ever
imagined!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorndyke listened attentively, deeply interested
in the human side of a man who had seemed to him to
have a very small amount of the purely human in
him. The little story of Letty Standiford&#8217;s health
and heart and nature did not strike him as puerile&mdash;there
was nothing puerile about Silas Standiford,
and his love for this child of his old age was, in
truth, a Titanic passion, strong enough, as he said,
to make him forego the chief object of his existence:
power over other men. Thorndyke really liked and
pitied Letty Standiford, living her young life without
guidance, in a manner possible only in America
and not desirable anywhere for a young girl. He
had not suspected the delicacy of her constitution,
and after Senator Standiford ceased speaking said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish, Senator, you could persuade Miss Standiford
to be a little more prudent about her health.
The night I dined out with her, when it came time
to go home she was about to pick up her skirts and
run two blocks to your hotel, in her satin slippers,
with sleet coming down, and the streets like glass&mdash;this,
for a lark. I took her by the arm and shoved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
her in a cab, got in myself, and took her home. I
thought she would box my ears before I got there,
but I carried my point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me about it&mdash;she tells me everything;
and I thank you for taking care of the child. You
may imagine what I suffer on her account.&#8221;</p>

<p>Senator Standiford rose then, and, resting both
hands on his old-fashioned gold-headed stick, he
looked full into Thorndyke&#8217;s face, and said, slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we understand each other, Mr. Thorndyke.
We think you a very strong man, and strong
men are liable to become dangerous. The State organisation
wishes you to remain where you are.
But in the event that I should be re-elected and
should be forced to resign, I have no hesitation in
saying that unless something unforeseen happens
you would certainly have my personal good wishes
toward getting you the party nomination for Senator.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand you perfectly, Senator,&#8221; replied
Thorndyke, with equal coolness, &#8220;and though I admit
I think it a shameful state of affairs that any
organisation or any man should have the power
to dispose of any man&#8217;s political future, yet it is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
fixed fact in our State and can&#8217;t be helped for the
present. So far as your personal kindness to me
goes I have the deepest sense of it, and the chances
are, on the strength of what you have just said, that
I may one day be senator.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when you are you won&#8217;t be as much down
on the State organisation as you are now,&#8221; remarked
Senator Standiford, beginning to climb the
marble steps. &#8220;You will probably be called a boss
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I shall not,&#8221; answered Thorndyke. &#8220;I
shouldn&#8217;t have the heart to put men through the
mill as I have seen you and Senator Bicknell and a
few others do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Senator Standiford professed to regard this as a
pleasantry, and so they entered the Capitol together.</p>

<p>The day was the regular one for the meeting of
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and there
was a full attendance, every member being prompt
except the chairman. Ten minutes after the hour
struck, Crane entered. It was almost impossible for
a man to have had the personal triumph he had enjoyed
the day before, without showing some consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
of it. Thorndyke had expected to see
Crane crowing like chanticleer. Instead, he was
remarkably quiet and subdued. He was greeted
with the chaff which senators and representatives
indulge in after the manner of collegians. Several
members addressed him as the &#8220;Wondrous Boy,&#8221;
and others, displaying copies of the Indianapolis
editorial, presented their claims to him for cabinet
places and embassies. One member&mdash;the Honourable
Mark Antony Hudgins, a colleague of Crane&#8217;s,
who posed as a greenhorn and was really a wit&mdash;solemnly
engaged Thorndyke to write him a speech
to deliver at the first seasonable opportunity, but
warned him not to make it too much like the speech
of the &#8220;Wondrous Boy.&#8221; Thorndyke laughed. He
had taken no part in the joking and chaffing.
Crane&#8217;s face flushed. He did not like to be reminded
of Thorndyke&#8217;s share in his success, but he was
too considerable a man to deny it.</p>

<p>The meeting was brief and devoted to routine
matters. The debate would begin directly after the
morning hour, and it was supposed it would go
along smoothly. There was, it is true, an able and
malevolent person from Massachusetts who would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
be likely to stick a knife between the joints of
Crane&#8217;s armour, and two or three Southern members
who would be certain to discover an infringement
of the Constitution of the United States in
something or other&mdash;but these were only the expected
rough spots in an otherwise smooth road.</p>

<p>At two o&#8217;clock the debate began. Again were
the galleries packed, though not to the same degree
as on the day before. When Crane rose to defend
the report he was loudly applauded. He was interrupted
once or twice by the able and malevolent
representative from Massachusetts, who never disappointed
expectations in that particular. And
there were some sly allusions to the Indianapolis
newspaper and the &#8220;Wondrous Boy.&#8221; This bothered
Crane obviously, who had a reasonable and
wholesome fear of ridicule. He had his share of a
certain crude humour&mdash;God never makes an American
without putting humour of some sort into him&mdash;but
Crane&#8217;s was not the rapid-fire, give-and-take
humour which counts in debate. He was always
afraid of committing some breach of taste and decorum
when he wished to raise a laugh. He remembered
certain men whose remarks had caused a tempest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
of mirth in the House, but those same remarks
seen in cold type next day had seriously damaged
their authors. It was here that Thorndyke came
to Crane&#8217;s rescue. While he sat glowering and
fuming and hesitating, Thorndyke stood in the
breach with a good story, full of wit and pith. The
House immediately went into convulsions of laughter.
The able and malevolent member from Massachusetts
in vain tried to bring the gentlemen back
to a state of seriousness and disgust with affairs
generally. But the turn injected by Thorndyke
into the discussion put everybody into a good humour,
the debate went swimmingly, as it was foreseen,
and when the adjournment came it was plain
that the report would be adopted substantially as
it came from the committee.</p>

<p>Thorndyke watched the big clock over the main
doorway, and precisely at four left the chamber,
and likewise left Crane to his fate, which, however,
proved to be easy enough. Thorndyke had other
business on hand then.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Five</i><br />


<small>A RAPTUROUS HOUR WHICH WAS RUDELY INTERRUPTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When Thorndyke got out of doors the bright
morning had changed into a cold, determined downpour
of rain. The gray mists hung over the city
at the foot of the hill, and the summit of the monument
was obscured by sullen driving clouds.
Thorndyke&#8217;s spirits rose as he surveyed the gloomy
prospect. It was not much of an afternoon for visiting&mdash;he
should find Constance alone.</p>

<p>He went to his rooms, dressed, and before five
was at Constance Maitland&#8217;s door. The afternoon
had grown worse. A sad northeast wind had been
added to the rain; the lilac-bushes in the little lawn
at the side of the house drooped forlornly, and the
dejected syringas looked like young ladies caught
out in the rain in their ball-gowns.</p>

<p>The rain, the cold, and the wind outside was the
best possible foil for the fire-lighted and flower-scented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
drawing-room, into which the young negro
butler ushered Thorndyke. The walls were of the
delicate pale green of the sea, the rug on the polished
floor was of the green of the moss. A wood fire
danced and sang in a white-tiled fireplace, and
laughed at its reflection in the quaint mirrors about
the room, and glowed upon family portraits and
miniatures on the walls. There were many old-fashioned
chairs and tables, and a deep, deep sofa drawn
up to the fire. By its side was a tea-table gleaming
with antique silver.</p>

<p>Like most men, Thorndyke was highly susceptible
to the environment of women without being in
the least able to analyse the feeling. It takes a
woman to dissect an emotion thoroughly. He became
at once conscious that this quaint, pretty,
sparkling drawing-room was a home, and that what
was in it had no connection whatever with shops
for antiques and art-sale catalogues. He had
often noticed with dislike the spurious antiquity
of many modern drawing-rooms, which are really
museums, and represent the desire of the new for
the old. But Constance Maitland had inherited the
furnishings which made her drawing-room beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
and distinctive, and in process of use, especially
by one family, chairs and tables and tea-kettles acquire
a semi-humanity which creates that subtle and
enduring thing called atmosphere. The portraits
on the walls gave an inhabited look to the room&mdash;it
was never without company.</p>

<p>While Thorndyke was considering the curious
fact that all the mere money in the world could not
create a drawing-room like Constance Maitland&#8217;s,
she herself entered the room with her slow, graceful
step. She wore a gown of a delicate gray colour,
which trailed upon the floor, and at her breast was
a knot of pale yellow cowslips. A bowl of the same
old-fashioned flowers was on the tea-table.</p>

<p>Thorndyke had never been able to contemplate
without agitation a meeting with Constance Maitland.
But, as on the two previous occasions, so soon
as he came face to face with her, nothing seemed
easier, sweeter, more natural than that they should
meet. He placed a chair for her, and they exchanged
smilingly the commonplaces of meeting
and greeting. At once Thorndyke felt that delicious
sense of comfort, security, and well-being
which some women can impart so exquisitely in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
their own homes. The quiet, fire-lighted room
seemed a paradise of peace and rest, which was accentuated
by the northeast storm without. The
surety that he would have the room, the fire, the
sweet company of Constance Maitland to himself
made Thorndyke feel almost as if he had a place
there. And Constance, by not taking too much notice
of him, increased the dear illusion. She got into
a spirited discussion with the negro butler, who rejoiced
in the good old-time name of Scipio, to
which Constance had added Africanus. Scipio had
his notions of how tea should be made, which were
at variance with his mistress&#8217;s. After the manner
of his race, he proceeded to argue the point. Constance
entered with spirit into the controversy, and
only settled it by informing Scipio that where tea
was concerned he was, and always would be, an
idiot, at which Scipio grinned in a superior manner.
Thorndyke thought Scipio in the right, and
said so, as he drank a very good cup of tea brewed
by Constance.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can never let Scipio believe for a moment
that I am in the wrong about anything,&#8221; replied
Constance, with pensive determination. &#8220;You dear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
good Northern people never can be made to understand
that with a negro everything depends on
the personal equation. He is not, and never can be
made, a human machine. He is a personality, and
his usefulness depends entirely on the recognition
of that personality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The commonly accepted idea of a servant is a
human machine,&#8221; said Thorndyke, willing to champion
Scipio&#8217;s cause for the purpose of having Constance
Maitland&#8217;s soft eyes glow and sweet voice
quicken in discussion. In the old days at Como
they had many hot wrangles over the North and the
South.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if you had been served by human machines
for eighteen years, as I was, you would understand
how I longed to see an honest, laughing black face
once more. My negro servants do much toward
making this house a home for me. You would
laugh at the way we get on together. When I am
in an ill humour they must bear the brunt of it.
I am a terrible scold when I am cross. But when the
servants are lazy and neglectful, then I bear with
them like an angel, and so we hit it off comfortably
together. Even Scipio Africanus, who is altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
idle and irresponsible, becomes a hero when I am
ill and a gentleman when I am angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another cup of tea, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Already? You will become a tea-drinker like
Doctor Johnson. However, my tea is so good that
you are excused.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation went on fitfully, but to Thorndyke
delightfully. Like all women who truly
know the world, Constance had a charming and
real simplicity about her. She made no effort
to entertain him. She talked to him and he replied
or was silent according to his mood.
Every moment increased Thorndyke&#8217;s sense of exquisite
comfort and quiet enjoyment. He had
reached the inevitable stage of life when amusements
are no longer warranted to amuse; when only
a few things remained, such as certain books and
certain conversations, which were a surety of pleasure.
Nor had it been much in his way to enjoy
those simple pleasures which are found only in
quiet and seclusion. It was as much a feeling of
gratitude as of enjoyment which made him say to
Constance:</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not think there remained for me such an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
hour of rest and refreshment as you have given
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Constance turned toward him, her eyes pensive
but not sad. There was something soothing in her
very presence. She had known and suffered much,
and had led a life far from quiet, and now, in her
maturity, she had reached, it seemed to her, a haven
of peace and quiet. She had acquired a knowledge
worth almost as much as youth itself&mdash;the knowledge
that never again could she suffer as she had
once suffered. And the meeting with Thorndyke
had confirmed her in a belief which had been her
chief solace under the sorrows of her life of exile
and disappointment. She knew he loved her well.
For some years of her youth she had been haunted
by the thought, cruel to her pride, that Thorndyke,
after all, had been only playing at love. But as
time went on, and she knew herself and others better,
she had become convinced that Thorndyke had
truly loved her, and his leaving her was only what
any other man of honour, burdened with poverty,
would have done. And he had remembered and suffered,
too. As this thought came into her mind
Thorndyke made some little remark that referred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
vaguely to their past, something about a song from
one of the Italian operas, those simple love-stories
told in lyrics which she had often sung in the old
days. A blush swept over Constance&#8217;s cheek, and
after a little pause of silence and hesitation she
went to the piano and sang the quaint old song.
She had a pleasing, although not a brilliant, voice,
and her singing was full of sweetness and feeling,
the only kind of singing which the normal man
really understands.</p>

<p>When she returned to her chair Thorndyke
leaned toward her with eyes which told her he loved
her, although he did not utter a word. Constance,
in turn, resting her rounded chin on her hand,
leaned toward him with a heavenly smile upon her
face&mdash;the smile a woman only bestows on the man
she loves. Even if he could never speak his love she
was conscious of it, and that was enough for her
woman&#8217;s heart. Under the spell of her eyes and
smile Thorndyke felt himself losing his head&mdash;how
could he refrain from touching the soft white hand
which hung so temptingly near him!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Crane,&#8221; announced Scipio Africanus, and
Julian Crane walked in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Every man receives a shock when he finds he has
interrupted a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, and Crane&#8217;s shock was
augmented by finding that Thorndyke was the victim
in the present case. Thorndyke had not said a
word about going to see Miss Maitland, and Crane
had meant to do a magnanimous thing by taking
him there! And while outside the door he had heard
Constance singing to the piano. She had never
mentioned to him that she had such an accomplishment.</p>

<p>Thorndyke behaved as men usually do under the
circumstances. He spoke to Crane curtly, assumed
an injured air, and took his leave promptly, as
much as to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible for me to stand this man a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Constance, womanlike, showed perfect composure
and politeness, bade Thorndyke good-bye with
a smile, and then, by an effort, brought herself to
the contemplation of Julian Crane. She saw then
that he was very pale, and the hand which he rested
on the back of a chair was trembling. The first
idea which occurred to her was that Crane had heard
bad news; but she could not understand why he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
should come to her under the circumstances. Perhaps
it was only nervousness, the relaxation after
great tension. With this in mind, she said pleasantly,
as they seated themselves:</p>

<p>&#8220;So you waked this morning and found yourself
famous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My speech appears to have been well received
by the country,&#8221; replied Crane, in a strained
voice, after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a pity Mrs. Crane was not present to enjoy
your triumph,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Crane does not care for politics,&#8221; replied
Crane, still in a strange voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot say that I am especially interested in
politics,&#8221; replied Constance, &#8220;but I am interested
in contemporary history of all sorts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And interested in your friends, Miss Maitland,
when they are in public life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Extremely. I was at the House yesterday to
hear you speak, and read your speech over again
this morning in the Congressional Record.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which, no doubt, you received through Thorndyke,&#8221;
Crane answered, pointedly, after a moment.</p>

<p>Constance felt an inclination, as she often did,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
to get up and leave the room when Crane was talking
with her. He had no reserves or restraints, and
said just what was in his mind&mdash;a dangerous and
alarming practice. She controlled herself, however,
and looked closer at Crane. He was evidently
deeply agitated, and Constance forbore the rebuke
that she was ready to speak. Like a true woman,
to feel sorry for a man was to forgive him everything.
Suddenly Crane burst out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard the news? Senator Brand&mdash;our
junior Senator&mdash;was run over by a train at
Baltimore this morning, and died within an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a way of announcing a death which
shows that the speaker is contemplating the dead
man&#8217;s shoes with particular interest. Without
fully taking in what it meant to Crane and what
he wished to convey, Constance at once saw that in
Senator Brand&#8217;s death lay some possible great
good for Crane. She remained silent a minute or
two, her mind involuntarily reconstructing the horror
and pity of the dead man&#8217;s taking off.</p>

<p>Crane rose and walked up and down the room,
his face working.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have committed a great, a stupendous folly,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
he said. &#8220;At the very outset of my real career I may
have ruined it. I couldn&#8217;t describe to you what I
have suffered this day&mdash;yet no one has suspected it.
I felt the necessity for sympathy, the necessity to
tell my story to some one, and I came to you. I
know I have no right to do it&mdash;but it seems to me,
Constance, that ever since the day I first saw you,
you have had some strange power of sustaining and
comforting me.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Crane spoke her name, Constance involuntarily
rose and assumed an air of offended dignity.
But Crane&#8217;s distress was so real, his offence so
unconscious, that her indignation could not hold
against him.</p>

<p>Without noticing her offended silence he came
and sat down heavily in the chair that Thorndyke
had just vacated.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he said, &#8220;in cases like this of Senator
Brand&#8217;s death, the Governor appoints a senator
until the Legislature meets and can elect, which will
not be until the first of next January. Just as I
had heard the news about poor Brand at my hotel
I ran into Sanders, our Governor. I didn&#8217;t know
he was in Washington. Sanders is a brute&mdash;always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
thinking of himself first. He button-holed me,
took me into his bedroom, locked the door, and
closed the transom. There were three other men
present&mdash;all of whom I would not wish to offend.
One of them has indorsed two unpaid notes for me.
Sanders told me he had been looking for me, and
with these other fellows&mdash;practical politicians
every one of them&mdash;had already formulated a plan
of campaign. The Governor would appoint me to
fill the vacancy until the Legislature met in January
and elected a senator for the short term, provided
I would give him a clear track then. In further
recompense, he agreed to support me for the
long term&mdash;the election is only two years off. Sanders
has had the senatorial bee in his bonnet for a
long time, but the State organisation is not over-kindly
to him, and Senator Bicknell is a little bit
afraid of him, and naturally wouldn&#8217;t encourage
his aspirations. And do you know, after an hour&#8217;s
talk I allowed Sanders and those three fellows to
wheedle me into that arrangement&mdash;and, of course,
I can&#8217;t, in two years, supplant Senator Bicknell.
Sanders is a long-headed rascal, and he knew very
well that I was under money obligations to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
men, and among them, aided and abetted by my
own folly, I was buncoed&mdash;yes, regularly buncoed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rage and shame that possessed him seemed
to overpower Crane for a moment, and he covered
his face with his hands. Then he dashed them down
and continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I could have made a good showing in
the race in January, and after my success of yesterday
I believe I could have won. Senator Bicknell
is not by any means the czar in the State which
he would wish people to believe. But because Sanders
dangled before my eyes the bauble of the appointment
to the Senate&mdash;a present mess of pottage&mdash;and
because I owed money I could not pay,
I gave up the finest prospect of success any man of
my age has had for forty years!&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane struck the arm of his chair with his
clinched fist. His furious and sombre eyes showed
the agony of his disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as it was done I knew my folly, and
since then I have been almost like a madman. I
went to my room to recover myself before going
to the Capitol, and managed not to betray myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
while I was there. But I couldn&#8217;t stand the strain
until adjournment; I had to come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Constance sat looking at him; pity, annoyance,
and a kind of disgust struggled within her. This,
then, was politics. Accomplished woman of the
world that she was, this natural and untutored man
thoroughly disconcerted her. If only she had not
felt such pity for him! And while she was contemplating
the spectacle of these elemental passions of
hatred, disappointment, revenge, and self-seeking,
Crane&#8217;s eyes, fixed on her, lost some of their fury,
and became more melancholy than angry, and he
continued, as if thinking aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Suddenly I felt the desire to see you. You
would know how insane was my folly, but you would
not despise me for it. That&#8217;s the greatest power in
the world a woman has over a man: when he can show
her all his heart, and she will pity him without scorn
or contempt. Ah, if Fate had given me a wife like
you, I could have reached the heights of greatness!&#8221;</p>

<p>At those words Constance Maitland moved a little
closer to him so that she could bring him under
the full effect of her large, clear gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said, in a cool, soft voice, with a rebuke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
in it, but without contempt, &#8220;that you are forgetting
yourself strangely. I have often noticed
in you a want of reticence. You should begin
now to cultivate reticence. What you have just
said has in it something insulting to me as well as
to your wife&mdash;a person you seem to have forgotten.
As for the political arrangement which you
regret so much, I can only say that it seems to me to
have been cold-blooded and unfeeling on both sides
to a remarkable degree. You have spoken plainly;
I speak plainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Constance leaned back quietly in her chair to
watch the effect of what she had said. She felt then
a hundred years older than Crane, who was older
than she, and who knew both law and politics well,
but was a child in the science of knowing the world
and the people in it&mdash;a science in which Constance
Maitland excelled. But even her rebuke had a fascination
for him. No other woman had ever rebuked
him&mdash;his wife least of all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you complain of me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for telling
you my weaknesses, my misfortunes? Don&#8217;t you
see that what you have just told me is proof of all I
have said? You see my faults, you tell me of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
you inspire me with a desire to correct them. No
other woman ever did so much for me. Is it forbidden
to any one to utter a regret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very often it is forbidden,&#8221; replied Constance,
promptly. &#8220;Unavailing regrets are among the
most undignified things on earth. Is it possible
that you have lived past your fortieth birthday
without getting rid of that school-boy idea that our
environment makes us&mdash;that a man is made by his
wife, or by any other human agent except himself?
So long as self-love is the master passion, so long
will we heed our own persuasions more than any
one else&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think you understand how things are
with me,&#8221; replied Crane, his eyes again growing
sombre. &#8220;Yesterday was an epoch-making day
with me. To-day, the first of the new epoch, I
make a hideous mistake. It unmans me; it unnerves
me. Not often do two such catastrophes befall
a man together. I follow an impulse and come
to you and you are angry with me. Bah! How narrow
and conventional are women, after all! Nevertheless,&#8221;
he kept on, rising to his feet and suddenly
throwing aside his dejection, &#8220;no man ever yet rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
to greatness without making vast mistakes and retrieving
them. This moment the way of retrieving
my mistake has come to me. I will go to Sanders&mdash;no,
I will write and keep a certified copy of the letter&mdash;saying
that I shall withdraw from my engagements
with him. I will refuse to accept the appointment
as Senator and will contest the election
with him before the Legislature. But&mdash;but&mdash;if
only the man who indorsed my notes hadn&#8217;t been in
the combine!&#8221;</p>

<p>As suddenly as he had rallied, Crane again sank
into dejection.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what it is to want money desperately&mdash;desperately,
I say,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no,&#8221; replied Constance, slowly. &#8220;I think I
know the want of everything else almost which is
necessary to happiness&mdash;except only the want of
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have escaped hell itself, Miss Maitland.
This American Government, which you think
so impeccable, is the most niggardly on the face of
the globe. With untold wealth, it pays the men
who conduct its affairs a miserable pittance&mdash;a bare
living. How can a man give his whole mind to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
great governmental and economic problems when
nine out of ten public men owe more than they can
pay? I owe more than I can pay, and I owe, besides,
a host of obligations of all sorts which the
borrower of money, especially if he is a public man,
cannot escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Constance, at this, felt more real pity and sympathy
for Crane than she had yet felt. Women being
in the main intensely practical, and in their
own singular way more material than men, the
want of money always appeals to them. And Constance
had an income much greater than her wants&mdash;that
is, unless she happened to want an American
husband. Every other luxury was within her reach.
This idea occurred to her grotesquely enough at
the moment. She said, after a moment&#8217;s pause:</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that to make your disentanglement
complete, you should, if possible, pay your
debt to the man that you say helped to wheedle you
into the arrangement. You might easily borrow the
money; it is probably not a large sum. If&mdash;if&mdash;perhaps
Mr. Thorndyke&mdash;might arrange&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane instantly divined the generous thought in
Constance Maitland&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know what you would do&mdash;through
Thorndyke. But it is not to be thought
of. With all my shortcomings, I can&#8217;t think of
borrowing money from a woman. But your suggestion
is admirable&mdash;the payment of the money is
necessary. It is not much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane named something under a thousand dollars&mdash;and
then fell silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Crane,&#8221; said Constance, after a while,
&#8220;what advice do you think your wife would give
you as to that money?&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane smiled a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Annette is a regular Spartan when it comes to
practical matters. She would advise me to give up
my rooms at the expensive hotel and go into the
country near-by for the balance of the session.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could any advice be more judicious?&#8221; asked
Constance. &#8220;And is it any disadvantage to a public
man, who is known to be a poor man, to live
plainly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Heaven!&#8221; exclaimed Crane. &#8220;You are right!
It would show those fellows in the Legislature next
January that I have clean hands. What an admirable
suggestion! And I can save at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
enough to pay half what I owe on that note before
the end of the session!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget,&#8221; said Constance, gently, &#8220;that the
suggestion really is your wife&#8217;s. Perhaps, if you
had listened to her oftener, you would have found
life easier. You are, perhaps, like many another
man&mdash;he marries a pretty little thing, and she remains
to him a pretty little thing. Meanwhile, she
may have developed a capacity for affairs far superior
to his.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane did not like the hint that perhaps Annette&#8217;s
head for affairs was better than his, but he
had heard several home-truths that afternoon.</p>

<p>He rose to go, and his changed aspect confirmed
his words when he said earnestly to Constance:</p>

<p>&#8220;I came in here with shame and despair in my
heart. I go away enlightened and encouraged and
comforted beyond words. You will at least let me
say that it is to you I owe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; replied Constance, cheerfully.</p>

<p>The feeling that another woman&#8217;s husband or
lover can be enlightened, encouraged, and comforted
by her is a very awkward circumstance to a
woman of sense.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Six</i><br />


<small>DEVILS AND ANGELS FIGHT FOR THE SOULS OF
MEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Crane went back to his rooms, wrote his letter to
Governor Sanders, and awaited developments.</p>

<p>Nothing happened for more than a week concerning
the senatorship. Meanwhile, he gave up
his expensive rooms, and with the assistance of a
note-broker managed to borrow enough money from
Peter to pay Paul and to relieve himself from present
obligations to one of the gentlemen who had so
urgently invited him to commit political hari-kari.
He secured quiet quarters in one of the suburbs of
Washington and found that he was quite as comfortable
as he had been at his high-priced hotel,
at about one-fourth the cost.</p>

<p>The May days that followed were cool and
bright and soft, as May days in Washington often
are. The called session of Congress and the necessary
presence of so many officials and diplomats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
made the gay town gayer than usual. The whole
country was in a mood of exhilaration and self-gratulation,
which was vividly reflected at Washington.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that Crane&#8217;s success was
real and substantial, and that he was already a person
to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>Crane hugged himself with satisfaction when he
reflected on his escape from being interned in the
Senate, forced to remain quiescent during the time
that he should have been most active, and finally enter
the senatorial contest, two years ahead, with a
reputation which would probably have dwindled as
rapidly as it had developed. Instead of that he was
in the centre of movement and interest, and even
if he could not make a serious effort before the Legislature
in January, he was in a good strategic position
for the senatorial election two years in advance&mdash;and
a great deal may happen in two years.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State, however, was disappointed
in Crane. He proved to be quite as intractable
as Thorndyke had been, and with less excuse&mdash;for
Thorndyke had never been asked to little dinners
at the Secretary&#8217;s house. The Secretary&#8217;s widowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
daughter, Mrs. Hill-Smith, the beautiful,
well-gowned, soft-voiced granddaughter of Cap&#8217;n
Josh Slater, of Ohio River fame, murmured once
or twice when Crane was under discussion that he
was &#8220;so very Western,&#8221; and assumed a rather apologetic
tone for having been seen at the play with
him. The Secretary himself, despairing of making
the chairman of the House Committee on Foreign
Affairs a handy tool for the State Department,
returned to his legitimate business. This business
consisted of labouring and slaving, in conjunction
with foreign chancelleries, to make elaborate
treaties, which the House and Senate treated as college
football teams treat the pigskin on hard-fought
fields. The Secretary felt peculiarly aggrieved over
the Brazilian affair, in which the State Department
made a ridiculously small figure, in spite of innumerable
letters, memoranda, protocols, treaties,
and what not. When the time came for action
the Congress had quietly taken the whole matter in
charge, and had not even censured the Secretary if
it could not praise him. Could he have been attacked
and denounced, as Mr. Balfour and M.
Combes and Chancellor von Buelow, and the Prime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Ministers of Europe were, it would have been a
consolation. But even this was cruelly denied him.
He had gone through all the strenuous forms of diplomacy
which meant something a hundred years
ago, when there was neither cable nor telegraph,
and when diplomats were not merely clerks and auditors
of their respective foreign offices. The Secretary
had practised all the diplomatic expedients
he knew. When he had not made up his mind what
to say to an ambassador, he had gone to bed with
lumbago. When he wished to impress one of the
great Powers of Europe with the notion that it had
in him a Bismarck to deal with, he had lighted a
cigar in the presence of five full-fledged ambassadors.
Remembering how eagerly the world always
waited for the speech of the Prime Minister of England
at the annual Lord Mayor&#8217;s banquet, the Secretary
had spent a whole month composing and revising
his remarks at a great banquet in New York
on Decoration Day, and the reporters had got his
speech all wrong, and a disrespectful New York
newspaper had made game of his trousers, had
compared them to Uncle Josh Whitcomb&#8217;s in &#8220;The
Old Homestead,&#8221; and had asked pertinently&mdash;or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
impertinently&mdash;where the Secretary had hired
them. In Congress he fared little better. The Senate
had taken some small notice of him. In the
House he had been practically ignored, except once
when a member alluded to having &#8220;an interview
with the Secretary of State.&#8221; A member of his own
party, the same Honourable Mark Antony Hudgins,
of Texas, who had guyed Crane, had sternly
rebuked his colleague for his phraseology, and declared
that what he should have said was &#8220;an audience
with the Prime Minister&#8221;&mdash;and the House
laughed at the unseemly joke. The Secretary had
in secret a low opinion of the collective wisdom of
Congress, and in this he was at one with the whole
diplomatic body in Washington.</p>

<p>Crane, like everybody else, had really forgotten
the Secretary in the press of affairs. He was
amazed at not receiving an answer to his letter to
Governor Sanders, and so told Thorndyke one
night a few days after their meeting at Constance
Maitland&#8217;s house. Crane had a great esteem for
Thorndyke&#8217;s sincerity, which was justified, and
Thorndyke, in his heart, was forced to admire
Crane&#8217;s force and to expect great things of him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
He did not entertain any doubt of Crane&#8217;s loyalty,
but he watched curiously the development
of the character of a man exposed to Crane&#8217;s peculiar
temptations. That Crane had both good and
bad qualities in great vigour he saw easily enough,
but he could not tell which were the fundamentals.
Crane was desperately poor, was foolishly proud,
was rash and vainglorious, and was destined to
shine brilliantly in the world of politics. What was
to become of such a man? What usually became of
such men? It was with these thoughts that Thorndyke,
at his lodgings, on a warm May night, listened
to Crane&#8217;s account of what had happened to
him in the last few days.</p>

<p>He assured Crane that his conduct regarding
Governor Sanders and the senatorship seemed eminently
sensible, after deducting the initial folly of
it. And his making his first serious attempt to save
money at the very time when it might be expected
he would become extravagant inclined Thorndyke
to the belief that Crane was, after all, fundamentally
honest.</p>

<p>Crane at that very moment suffered from a feeling
of conscious guilt. He had begun to practise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
more than the one virtue of economy. He was practising
several others, but all with a view to his own
advantage. One of them was that his wife should
come on and visit him during the remainder of the
session. She had not been in Washington for five
years&mdash;not since that first unlucky venture in the
Eleventh Street boarding-house.</p>

<p>He mentioned to Thorndyke his intention to send
for his wife, and had the grace to say that it was because
he was lonely without her&mdash;and in saying so
he was conscious of uttering a colossal lie. But being
inexpert as a liar he did badly, and felt ashamed
of doing badly even in lying.</p>

<p>Thorndyke, on whom Annette Crane&#8217;s simple
and natural charm had made a strong impression,
was pleased at the thought that Crane would pay
her the compliment of having her with him and
pleased at the thought of seeing her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be going West next week,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
if Mrs. Crane is ready to come to Washington
I shall be proud to escort her back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; answered Crane, &#8220;it would be a
kindness to me as well as to Mrs. Crane. She is not
an experienced traveller.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Both Thorndyke and Crane when they were together
desired to keep Constance Maitland out of
their conversation, but by one of those contradictory
and involuntary impulses which cannot be
accounted for, her name always came up between
them. This time it was by Crane&#8217;s saying, after a
while:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen Miss Maitland lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dined there night before last,&#8221; answered
Thorndyke.</p>

<p>Crane knew that Constance Maitland&#8217;s favourite
form of entertaining was at little dinners, which
were perfection in the way of guests and service.
He had never been asked to one of them, and
thought gloomily that after Constance&#8217;s very plain
speaking to him at their last interview his chance of
being invited was thin to attenuation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that the night that fellow Hudgins from
Texas dined there?&#8221; asked Crane, who had not
taken Constance&#8217;s sound advice to cultivate reticence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I never saw a better dinner-man than
Hudgins, nor was ever at a more agreeable dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh! Hudgins?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;Yes, Hudgins. The fellow has a quiet manner,
a soft voice, and the most delightful and archaic
reverence for &#8216;the ladies,&#8217; as he calls them. It is
like what history tells us of General Sam Houston.
Hudgins was a screaming success at the dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing that the account of Hudgins&#8217;s triumph
gave Crane acute discomfort, Thomdyke, lighting
a fresh cigar, kept on remorselessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Maitland wanted to ask some really representative
man to meet Sir Mark le Poer, a very
agreeable and considerable Englishman, one of the
permanent under-secretaries in the British Foreign
Office&mdash;it seems he is a great friend of hers. He
had been gorgeously entertained by all the retired
trades-people who are in the smart set here, but
complained that he hadn&#8217;t met any Americans&mdash;they
<i>would</i> ask all the diplomats to meet him, fellows
that bored him to death in Europe and still
more so here. It seems that Miss Maitland had
heard that the long, thin, soft-voiced Texan was
delightful at dinner&mdash;so she asked me to bring him
to call, and the dinner invitation followed. Besides
Sir Mark and Hudgins and myself, there was Cathcart&mdash;a
navy man&mdash;good old New England family,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
four generations in the navy, travelled man of
the world, and flower of civilisation. But Hudgins
was easily the star of the occasion. There were
three other women present besides Miss Maitland,
all of them charming women, who know the world
and command it; and the way they, as well as the
Englishman and the naval officer, fell in love with
Hudgins and his soft Texas accent, and his stupendous
Texas yarns, and his way of looking at things&mdash;well,
it was a show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come, Thorndyke&mdash;Hudgins!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Hudgins, I tell you. When the time came
for the ladies to leave the table none of them wanted
to go, and they said so. Then Hudgins rose and
said in that inimitable manner of his, which catches
the women every time, &#8216;If Miss Maitland would
kindly permit it, I&#8217;d rather a million times go into
the parlour with her and the other ladies than stay
out here with these fellows. I can get the society
of men and a cigar any day, but it isn&#8217;t often that
I can bask in the presence of ladies like these present.&#8217;
And the presumptuous dog actually walked
off and left us in the lurch&mdash;and you can depend
upon it, the women liked him better than any of
us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>&#8220;If women are won by compliments like that, any
man can win their favour,&#8221; said Crane, crossly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, women know vastly more than
we do. It wasn&#8217;t Hudgins&#8217;s compliments in words
that won the women&mdash;it was his giving up his cigar
and the extra glass of champagne and the society
of men that fetched &#8217;em&mdash;it was the sincerity of the
thing. When we went into the drawing-room Hudgins
was sitting on the piano-stool telling them some
sentimental story about his mother down in Texas
when he started out in life, with nothing but the
clothes on his back and a six-shooter in his pocket.
The women were nearly in tears. As for the rest of
us, including Sir Mark le Poer, we simply weren&#8217;t
in it with Hudgins. We stayed until nearly midnight;
then the men adjourned to the club, where
Hudgins kept us until three o&#8217;clock in the morning
telling us more yarns about Texas. Sir Mark
would hardly let him out of sight, and Hudgins has
engaged to spend August with him in Scotland at
a splendid place he has near Inverness. That&#8217;s the
way a man with great natural gifts of entertaining
and being entertained can get on, if he has a
chance.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Crane felt humiliated and disappointed. In all
honesty, he could not imagine why he, with his recognised
talents, his extreme good looks, his fondness
for society, should have no such social triumphs
as that long, lean, lanky Texan. He had not
grasped the truth that society is a pure democracy,
and until a man has abandoned all pretensions to
superiority he will not be acceptable in it.</p>

<p>Just then, along the dusky street a carriage came
rolling. At Thorndyke&#8217;s door it stopped, a footman
descended from the box and assisted Senator
Bicknell to alight.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Senator has come hunting you up,&#8221; Thorndyke
remarked to Crane. &#8220;When a man is anxious
enough to see you to come after you, it is generally
possible to make your own terms with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane&#8217;s backbone was considerably stiffened by
this remark of Thorndyke&#8217;s, and then Senator Bicknell
walked in the room and greeted Thorndyke and
Crane affably. He made an elaborate apology for
seeking Crane, but said frankly he wished to discuss
some matters of State politics with him.</p>

<p>Thorndyke at once rose to leave the room, but
Crane, asking Senator Bicknell if he had any objection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
to Thorndyke&#8217;s remaining and the Senator
feebly agreeing to it, Thorndyke sat down again
to enjoy the scrap. As it was not in his own party,
he was a perfectly disinterested listener.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Crane,&#8221; began Senator Bicknell, in a dulcet
voice, &#8220;I hardly think you realise what it means to
our State organisation to introduce discord into it
at this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was less than fourteen months before a national
convention and the rainbow of a Presidential
nomination had arisen upon Senator Bicknell&#8217;s political
horizon. This had happened more than once,
but the Senator had never been able, heretofore, to
catch the rainbow by the tail&mdash;yet, hope springs
eternal in the human breast.</p>

<p>To this Crane replied, firmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I desire, Senator, to do everything I can to
promote harmony in the State organisation. It is
Governor Sanders who is making trouble, and I
shall defend myself from him, and die in the last
ditch, if necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane was by nature a gladiator, and the prospect
of a fight by no means discomposed him.</p>

<p>Senator Bicknell sighed. He had already on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
hands nine bloody fights in various parts of the
State, and the prospect of a tenth fight, of a triangular
nature at that, with two such sluggers as
Crane and the Governor of the State, made the Senator&#8217;s
head ache. He looked sadly at Thorndyke
and yearned after a knowledge of the secret by
which his friend, Senator Standiford, could get
hold of a man like Thorndyke, and keep him forever
in a subordinate position, while he, Senator Bicknell,
was always engaged in a tussle with his lieutenants.</p>

<p>Crane improved the opportunity to explain fully
his position; and there could not be the slightest
doubt that he had narrowly escaped from a conspiracy
meant to ruin him.</p>

<p>Senator Bicknell said little and was evidently impressed
by Crane&#8217;s statement. Thorndyke was
mentally comparing his own boss with Crane&#8217;s boss.
All the pleas in the world would not have availed
Crane had he been dealing with Standiford. He
would have been required to sacrifice himself without
a moment&#8217;s hesitation and accept the disastrous
honour of the senatorial appointment or be quietly
put out of the way. Politics with Senator Standiford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
was a warfare in which quarter was neither
asked nor given, and no time was permitted to succour
the wounded or bury the dead. Yet Thorndyke
doubted if Senator Bicknell, or any man
then in public life, had ever known a tithe of the
tremendous parental passion which Senator Standiford
had for his daughter. So strange a thing is
human nature.</p>

<p>A discussion followed Crane&#8217;s words which made
a very important fact clear: that Crane had suddenly
become a factor in State politics. Crane&#8217;s
colour deepened as Senator Bicknell made a last
effort with him for peace with Sanders, and when
it was met with a firm refusal to accept the appointment,
Senator Bicknell dropped some words which
indicated plainly that if forced to choose sides he
might be with Crane. For a man who a month before
had been obscure this was a vast though silent
triumph.</p>

<p>After an hour&#8217;s talk Senator Bicknell got up and
departed. It was well on toward ten o&#8217;clock, and
Crane, too, rose to go. Thorndyke went out with
him and they walked together as far as the foot of
the hill at Connecticut Avenue. Then Thorndyke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
turned back, to indulge in a folly which had been
his nightly, since that first afternoon with Constance
Maitland. It was, to pass within sight of her house,
then to return sick at heart to his own rooms and
ask himself if he could be such a fool as to wish her
to give up that charming home for lodgings such
as he could afford.</p>

<p>Crane presently reached his quarters, a comfortable
suburban house with many verandas, and not
unlike his own house at Circleville. On the table in
his room lay a parcel, evidently containing photographs.
He opened it and took out a photograph
of his wife with her two children, Roger and Elizabeth,
by her side. The children were handsome&mdash;the
boy the sturdy, well-made replica of his father, the
little girl her mother in miniature; both of them
children of whom any father might be proud. As
for Annette, the sweetness, the soft, appealing
character of her beauty, was singularly brought out
in the photograph. Nor was there any suspicion
of weakness in the face, which most men would have
fallen in love with on the spot.</p>

<p>But Crane was dissatisfied. She was not a woman
even to be talked about. Crane would have liked a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
woman whose name would be in the newspapers
every day. True, Constance Maitland kept out of
them all she could, but she was too striking a personality
not to attract the attention of the society
correspondents. If she had been the wife of a public
man, she would have been in print quite as often
as he was.</p>

<p>Still Crane was glad he had sent for his wife.
He had not realised until this crisis in his fate had
come upon him what a mistake he had made in not
having her with him sometimes. Not a man of his
acquaintance who owned a wife but had her occasionally
in Washington. He began to think with
terror of what his enemies might have to say concerning
this, and then, going to his table, wrote
Annette another letter more urgent than his first,
in his desire that she should come to Washington.
He mentioned the chance that Thorndyke, who had
never failed to show interest in her, had offered to
escort her East. He felt like a hero and a martyr
while writing this. But after he had posted his letter,
and he had gone back to the balcony of his room
and gazed out into the solemn night, he had a return
of that strange sense of guilt. He felt like a hypocrite;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
and, as he was not a hypocrite by nature, the
feeling was uncomfortable. He put his request to
Annette on the same ground he had alleged to
Thorndyke&mdash;his wish to see her. And he ought to
wish to see her&mdash;he <i>did</i> wish to see her; but the stillness
of the night and the presence of the stars is
disconcerting sometimes to one&#8217;s conscience. The
stars were very bright and it was wonderfully clear,
although the moon was just rising. Tall apartment
houses blazing with light made centres of radiance
in the purple night. The Washington monolith
was like a pillar of cloud, and the dome of the Capitol
seemed suspended in mid-air. It was all very
beautiful, but Crane saw nothing of its beauty. He
saw only before him a struggle with stupendous
forces&mdash;these he feared not&mdash;but also a struggle
with himself; and this he feared! He went to bed
and slept uneasily.</p>

<small>HOW VARIOUS PERSONS SPENT A MAY SUNDAY IN
WASHINGTON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Next morning Crane rose with the intention of
going to church&mdash;a thing he had not done for
years. And in the practice of this virtue he committed
an act of the greatest hypocrisy. He knew
the very hour when Hardeman, the correspondent
of his home paper, took his Sunday morning stroll
on Connecticut Avenue. Crane timed his own appearance
so that he met Hardeman directly in front
of the Austrian Embassy.</p>

<p>In half a minute afterward Crane mentioned that
he was on his way to church.</p>

<p>As he spoke Hardeman took a newspaper out of
his pocket, and opening it, held it up before Crane.
On the first page, with the most violent display-head,
was the official announcement of his appointment
by Governor Sanders to the unexpired time
of the late Senator Brand&#8217;s term.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Crane turned pale. He was ready for the fight,
but the fight had come unexpectedly soon. And
that it was to be to the knife, and knife to the hilt,
was now perfectly plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; said he to Hardeman, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
tell you all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned back to Dupont Circle, seated themselves
on a bench left vacant by a coloured brother,
and Crane told the whole story to Hardeman to be
printed next day.</p>

<p>As he talked, his course of action, simple, above-board,
and effective, at once took shape in his mind.
He wrote out on a pocket-pad a letter to the Governor,
saying as the Governor had thought fit to
make the public aware of his action in the senatorship
before communicating with Crane himself,
that he, Crane, should do likewise and make a public
declination of it. He then gave a brief statement
of what had passed, inserted a copy of his
first letter to the Governor, and reiterated his refusal
to accept the senatorship. Hardeman, a keen-eyed
man, was in the seventh heaven of delight.
The letter would, of course, be sent to the Associated
Press, but there was &#8220;a good story&#8221; for the home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
paper, and a specific mention that Representative
Crane was on his way to church when the news was
communicated to him.</p>

<p>Crane, still pale, rose and announced that he
should keep on to church&mdash;a fact also certain to be
chronicled. Church was a very good place to think
out the problems which would come out of this extraordinary
and far-reaching fight.</p>

<p>He went on, sat through a long sermon of which
he heard not a word, listened to the musical gymnastics
of a high-priced quartette, and gradually
became himself, or, rather, more than himself, for
the fight at hand brought out in him all the thews
and sinews of courage, foresight, and judgment.
At the very last, when the name of God was mentioned
in the final prayer, Crane had one moment
of sincere piety. Otherwise his thoughts were very
far from pious, being absolutely those of self-seeking
and revenge. Like other men, he promised himself
that when Mammon had granted him all he
wanted, then he would turn to God.</p>

<p>When he found himself on the street again it
was a little past twelve o&#8217;clock. He turned into
the side streets to escape the throng of people going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
home from church. As he walked under the arcade
of the sweet-smelling tulip-trees with the May sunshine
filtering through, he felt the ever-present
longing for sympathy. He would have liked to
go to Constance Maitland, but something in her
tone and manner at their last meeting made him
afraid.</p>

<p>On that former occasion he had scarcely been
master of himself, he did not know when he was
offending her; but now he was far more composed.
Yet he dared not go.</p>

<p>While these thoughts were passing through his
mind he looked up and saw Constance coming down
the street under the dappled shadows of the tulip-trees.
She was dressed simply in black, but Crane
had never been more struck by the distinction of her
appearance. With her was a fine-looking man
whom Crane surmised was Cathcart, the naval man.
Crane intended to pass the pair without stopping,
but when he raised his hat Constance halted him.
There was that ever-present feeling of pity for
him, and she was conscious of having said some hard
things to him in that last interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have glanced at the newspaper this morning,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
she said, &#8220;and I fancy your friend, Governor Sanders,
has treated you rather shabbily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very shabbily,&#8221; replied Crane, smiling; &#8220;he has
driven me to the wall, but he will find me fighting
with my back to the wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Constance introduced her companion, and
it was Cathcart, after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t expect much sympathy from me, Mr.
Crane,&#8221; said Cathcart, smiling. &#8220;If it had not
been for you and your colleagues I might have been
in command of a ship at this moment, making a run
for the Caribbean Sea. You did us naval men a
bad turn by forcing those beggars to back down
without striking a blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cathcart, like all naval men, was eager to play
the great game of war with the new implements
lately acquired, and did not welcome the exercise of
peaceful power which had forced an amicable arrangement
of a dangerous question.</p>

<p>Just then a handsome victoria drew up at the
sidewalk. In it sat Mrs. Hill-Smith, the widowed
daughter of the Secretary of State, and a beautifully
dressed, high-bred-looking girl, Eleanor
Baldwin. Baldwin, <i>p&egrave;re</i>, whose cards read, &#8220;Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
James Brentwood Baldwin,&#8221; was the successful inventor
of a machine for stitching shoes, which had
brought him a great fortune early in life, and had
enabled him to establish himself in Washington and
adopt the r&ocirc;le of a gentleman of leisure and of inherited
fortune. His daughter looked like the
younger sister of Lady Clara Vere de Vere, as Mrs.
Hill-Smith, Cap&#8217;n Josh Slater&#8217;s granddaughter,
looked like Lady Clara Vere de Vere herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill-Smith beckoned to Constance, who approached,
leaving the two men a little distance
away talking together under the overhanging
branches of the tulip-trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear girl,&#8221; said Mrs. Hill-Smith, who had
adopted the &#8220;dear girl&#8221; mode of addressing all
women like herself over thirty-five, &#8220;you must come
to the meeting of the Guild for Superannuated
Governesses, which is to be organised at my house
to-morrow. It is a branch of the one presided over
in London by the Princess Christian&#8221;&mdash;and Mrs.
Hill-Smith ran over glibly a number of names of
ladies of the diplomatic corps in Washington who
were interested in it, winding up with, &#8220;And we
<i>can&#8217;t</i> get on without you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>Constance Maitland&#8217;s full gaze had in it power
over women as well as over men, and Mrs. Hill-Smith
was not quite certain whether there was a
laugh or not in Constance&#8217;s deep, dark eyes, as
turning them on her she replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well&mdash;but my first proposition will be revolutionary,
I warn you. I shall suggest that we
pay governesses enough to enable them to save
something, and thus we can get hold of the economic
problem by the head instead of by the tail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was she really in earnest? Mrs. Hill-Smith did
not know, but there was certainly a flippancy in
Constance&#8217;s tone which shocked both Mrs. Hill-Smith
and Miss Baldwin. The serious, hard-working
women by whom they were mothered and grandmothered
had given them a deadly soberness and
energy in the pursuit of social schemes and pleasures,
just as their forbears had industriously and
seriously washed and baked and brewed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill-Smith was so annoyed by Constance&#8217;s
manner of receiving her communication that if
Constance had not been very intimate at the British
Embassy Mrs. Hill-Smith would have made her displeasure
felt. But she was constitutionally timid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
like all social new-comers&mdash;timid in admitting people
into her circle, and timid in turning them out&mdash;so
she merely smiled brightly and said as they drove
off:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come like a dear, and be as revolutionary
as you please. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Constance, with her two men, lingered a minute,
and then Crane left her. He yearned for his stenographer,
and set out to seek him. Cathcart
walked home with Constance and left her at the
door. She was malicious enough to describe to him
some of Mrs. Hill-Smith&#8217;s charities, at which Cathcart
was in an ecstasy of amusement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Hill-Smith went home with
Eleanor Baldwin to what they called breakfast, but
most Americans call luncheon. On the way the two
women had discussed Constance Maitland cautiously&mdash;each
afraid to let on to the other what she really
thought&mdash;because, after all, Constance was intimate
at the British Embassy.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Baldwin house&mdash;an imposing
white stone mansion, with twenty-five bedrooms for
a family of four, of whom one was a boy at school,
a family which never had a visitor overnight&mdash;Eleanor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
led the way to the library, where her father
sat.</p>

<p>It was a great, high-ceiled, cool room, dark, in
spite of many windows and a glass door opening
on a balcony. At a library table near the glass door
sat Mr. James Brentwood Baldwin, alias Jim Baldwin,
and on the balcony outside, under the awning,
sat Mrs. James Baldwin, n&eacute;e Hogan.</p>

<p>It was easy to see whence Eleanor Baldwin had
got her beauty. Jim Baldwin was handsome, Nora
Hogan Baldwin was handsomer.</p>

<p>From the days when Jim Baldwin had carried
home parcels of tea and buckets of butter in his
father-in-law&#8217;s corner grocery, he had cherished an
honourable ambition to have a great big library
full of books. In the course of time, through the
operations of the shoe-stitching machine, he had
been able to gratify this ambition and taste. He had
all of those books which Charles Lamb declares &#8220;are
no books&mdash;that is, all the books which no gentleman&#8217;s
library should be without.&#8221; They were all
bound sumptuously in calf, and &eacute;ditions de luxe
were as common as flies in a baker&#8217;s shop. The four
vast walls were lined with these treasures, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
them Baldwin derived an excess of pleasure. This
was not by reading them&mdash;he had never read a book
in his life. Two Chicago newspapers, one from
New York, and the Washington morning and evening
papers satisfied his cravings for knowledge.
But he got from the outside of his books all the
pleasure that most people get from the inside. He
justly felt that to be seen surrounded by the glorious
company of the living who died a thousand
years ago, and the conspicuous dead who live to-day,
was to give him dignity and poise. Nobody
but himself knew that he never read. His days were
spent in his library&mdash;he always spoke of himself as
&#8220;among my books&#8221;&mdash;and shrewd, sharp, and keen
as he was and ever must remain, he had actually
succeeded in bamboozling himself into the notion
that he was a person of &#8220;literary tastes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin was one of the handsomest women
in Washington, and considered quite the proudest.
Her abundant grey hair, setting off a face of Grecian
beauty, gave her a look as of a queen in the
days of powder and patches. She had a rarity of
speech, a way of looking straight ahead of her,
which was regal. But this exterior of pride was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
really a result of the sincerest bashfulness and reserve.
When Nora Hogan, the grocer&#8217;s daughter,
had married Jim Baldwin, the contractor&#8217;s son,
Fortune was already smiling on Jim. Then suddenly
she opened her apron and deluged him with gold.
Mrs. Baldwin was frightened and stunned. She was
afraid to say much for fear she might make mistakes&mdash;so
she gradually came to saying nothing at
all. She dreaded to look from side to side for fear
she might find some one laughing at her. So she
always looked straight ahead of her. By degrees
she acquired a degree of coldness, of stiffness, that
was perfectly well suited to the mother of Lady
Clara Vere de Vere. She was, of course, an unhappy
woman, being a misjudged one. Her chief
solace lay in the practice of secret acts of charity
among the poorest of the poor, not letting her left
hand know what her right hand did. The promoters
of fashionable charities complained that Mrs.
Baldwin was so stately and so unsympathetic that
they could not get on with her in charitable work.
True it is, that at the meetings for fashionable charities
Mrs. Baldwin would be more silent, more
queenly than ever, but her heart would be crying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
aloud for the poor who are born to suffer and to
die, and to have helped them she would cheerfully
have given the very clothes off her back. But cowardice
kept her silent, as it kept her silent in the
presence of her servants, whom she feared inexpressibly.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Baldwin was constitutionally timid, not
so Eleanor. All the courage of her father had
gone into his willowy, beautiful, well-groomed
daughter. Her first recollections were of the inland
town where they lived secluded in their big
house, because nobody was good enough for them
to associate with after their fortune was made.
Then she was taken to Europe and returned a finished
product, with no more notion of what the
word &#8220;American&#8221; meant than if she had been a
daughter of the Hapsburgs. As a compromise between
Europe and America, Baldwin had pitched
upon Washington as a place of residence. His social
status had been agreeably fixed by a lucky accident&mdash;he
had been asked to be pall-bearer for a
foreign Minister who died in Washington. Baldwin
rightly considered the dead diplomat worth, to
him, all the live ones going; for, having assisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
in carrying the dead man from the Legation to the
hearse, Baldwin was, in consequence, elected to
the swell club, asked to the smart cotillion, and
made more headway in a month in the smart set
than he could have made otherwise in a year. He
repaid his debt to the dead diplomat by buying
some very ordinary pictures at the sale of the Minister&#8217;s
effects, and paying the most extravagant
price ever heard of for them.</p>

<p>To Eleanor their social rise was nothing surprising.
She expected it, having been bred like a
young princess, only with less of democracy than
real princesses are bred. When she entered the
room with Mrs. Hill-Smith, Baldwin rose and responded
smilingly to Mrs. Hill-Smith&#8217;s remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are, as usual, among your books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;as usual, among my books. I daresay
your father, the Secretary, spends a good deal of
time among <i>his</i> books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied Mrs. Hill-Smith, airily, &#8220;but
he has been dreadfully put out of late. Congress
has been so troublesome. I don&#8217;t know exactly <i>how</i>,
but it has annoyed papa extremely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very reprehensible,&#8221; said Baldwin, earnestly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
who had the opinion of the average commercial
man that Congress is a machine to create prosperity,
or its reverse, and if prosperity is not created,
Congressmen are blamed fools.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>hate</i> Congressmen&mdash;except a few from New
York,&#8221; said Eleanor, drawing off her gloves daintily.
&#8220;There was one talking to Miss Maitland when
we stopped her on the street just now. The creature
was introduced to me at one of those queer
Southern houses where they introduce people without
asking permission first, and ever since then the
man has tried to talk to me whenever we meet. But
I really couldn&#8217;t stand him. This morning I cut
him dead. His name is Crane, and he&#8217;s from somewhere
in the West.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it happened that there was another Crane
in the House from the West, and Baldwin had a
business motive for wishing to cultivate this particular
Crane&mdash;and business was business still with
Jim Baldwin. So, at Eleanor&#8217;s words, he turned on
her. His air of scholar-and-gentleman, man-of-the-world,
and person-of-inherited-leisure suddenly
dropped from him; he was once more Jim Baldwin,
the shoe-stitching-machine man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;Then let me tell you,&#8221; he said, authoritatively,
&#8220;you made a big mistake. That man Crane is on
the Committee on Manufactures, and we have been
arguing with him, and sending the most expensive
men we have to prove to him that we are entitled to
the same rebate on the platinum used in our machines
as the Oshkosh Shoe-Stitching-Machine people
get&mdash;and I have reason to know that Crane is
the man standing in the way. I wish you had snuggled
right up to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor surveyed her father with cold displeasure.
Mrs. Hill-Smith was politely oblivious, especially
of the word &#8220;snuggled.&#8221; Coming, as she did,
of a very old family which dated back to 1860, she
felt a certain degree of commiseration for brand-new
people like the Baldwins, who had not appeared
above the social horizon until 1880&mdash;twenty years
later. But she really liked them, and with a diplomatic
instinct inherited from her father she relieved
the situation by rising and saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I see dear Mrs. Baldwin on the balcony and
must go and speak to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as she flitted through the glass door a deep
masculine voice just behind Eleanor said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>&#8220;Good morning, Miss Baldwin.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the Honourable Edward George Francis
Castlestuart-Stuart, third secretary of the British
Embassy, whom Eleanor had asked to breakfast that
morning. She grew pale as she rose to greet him&mdash;suppose&mdash;suppose
he had heard that remark about
the shoe-stitching machine? And what was more
likely? The shoe-stitching machine was the family
skeleton, and was usually kept under lock and key.
By some occult and malign impulse her father had
hauled it out and rattled it in Mrs. Hill-Smith&#8217;s
face, and perhaps it might be known at the British
Embassy!</p>

<p>Baldwin himself realised the impropriety of his
conduct, and tried to rectify it by saying, with great
cordiality, to the Honourable Mr. Castlestuart-Stuart:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning&mdash;good morning. Very pleased
to see you. You find me, as usual, among my books&mdash;my
best and oldest friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this Castlestuart-Stuart replied simply, like
the honest Briton that he was:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate books.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldwin was nearly paralysed at this, and still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
more so when the honest Briton quite eagerly went
out on the balcony to speak to Mrs. Baldwin. Only
the day before, in one of his rambles about town, he
had come upon her getting out of a cab before a
poor lodging-house in Southeast Washington, her
arms loaded with bundles. A swarm of poor children
had run forward to greet her&mdash;they evidently
knew her well. Her usually cold, statuesque face
had been warmed with the sweet light of charity, and
a heavenly joy shone in her eyes in the process of
feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and visiting
the sick.</p>

<p>As Castlestuart-Stuart went out on the balcony
and took Mrs. Baldwin&#8217;s hand cordially, she
blushed, but not painfully. She, too, had seen him
yesterday, and he had managed to convey with that
peculiar art of a simple and candid nature that he
admired her for what she was doing. Again did she
feel this sincere and admiring approval, and was
profoundly grateful for it. Castlestuart-Stuart
knew the history of the family&mdash;all the diplomats
in Washington know the family history of those who
race and chase after them. He remembered hearing
Constance Maitland say &#8220;Mrs. Baldwin redeems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the whole family.&#8221; Goodness such as hers
could redeem much worse people than the Baldwins,
thought Castlestuart-Stuart, and he proceeded to be
bored by Mrs. Hill-Smith and Eleanor with the best
grace in the world. His chief had told him to take
what was set before him in a social way, asking no
questions for conscience&#8217; sake. In the performance
of his duty he had dined, breakfasted, and lunched
with pork, dry-goods, whiskey, shoes, sewing-machines,
and every other form of good, honest trade.
But the word trade was never so much as mentioned
among them&mdash;certainly not at the breakfast which
was now served.</p>

<small>A NEW SENATOR&mdash;A RAILWAY JOURNEY&mdash;THE ROSE
OF THE FIELD AND THE ROSES OF THE GARDEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Crane was in nowise disappointed at the sensation
his published letter made. The justice of his position
was at once apparent. But it was equally apparent
that he was making a serious break in the
political dykes which held the party together in his
State against the ocean of the party opposed to it.
Under Senator Bicknell&#8217;s rule, insubordination had
gradually crept in. The late landslide, which had
elected a Congress in opposition to the party in
power, increased the importance of States like
Crane&#8217;s, where the balance of power shifted about
every ten years between the two parties. Senator
Bicknell, in the seclusion of his boudoir&mdash;for such
was his luxurious den in reality&mdash;tore his hair and
used all of the expletives permissible in polite society.
In a week or two Governor Sanders, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
any further newspaper controversy, appointed to
the vacant senatorship Mr. Michael Patrick Mulligan,
a gentleman of Hibernian descent, who had
made a vast fortune out of manufacturing pies
by the wholesale, and who cherished an honourable
ambition to legislate for the hated Saxon.
Senator Bicknell, Crane, and everybody in the
State knew of Mr. Michael Patrick Mulligan,
who was commonly called Mince Pie Mulligan.
He was a ward politician of the sort peculiarly
unhampered by prejudices or principles,
and who bought and sold votes by wholesale, very
much as he bought and sold pies. He was totally
without education, but by no means without brains,
and proposed to himself a seat in the Senate as an
agreeable diversion, without the least idea of doing
anything beyond voting as directed by &#8220;the boss&#8221;&mdash;for
so he designated the Senator who was chairman
of the National Committee of Mr. Mulligan&#8217;s
party. It was, on the whole, about as harmless an
appointment as could be made. Mulligan&#8217;s private
life was perfectly clean, and he was known to have
an open hand for charity, and never to have forgotten
a friend. It gave both Senator Bicknell and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
Crane a breathing-spell, and they were willing
enough to put up with Mince Pie Mulligan until the
first of January.</p>

<p>Senator Bicknell, although easy enough in his
mind about Mulligan, was far from easy about
Crane, who had gone up like a rocket, but showed no
disposition to come down like a stick. The Senator
got into the way of stealing over to the House, &#8220;just
to see how things are going&#8221;&mdash;in reality to see how
Crane was going&mdash;and it scared him to observe how
Crane was making good his footing everywhere.
His first triumph, even after subtracting Thorndyke&#8217;s
assistance, had been a real triumph. Following
hard on this came his controversy with the Governor,
in which he clearly had the best of it. The
shrewd men in his party saw that in the readjustment
of allegiances Crane must be counted, and the
chairman of the National Committee said as much
to Senator Bicknell when the two discussed the war
between the Governor and Representative Crane.
When the chairman said that, Senator Bicknell felt
as Henry IV. of England felt when he saw the
Prince of Wales trying on the crown before the
looking-glass.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Meanwhile, Thorndyke was speeding West, as he
had said, and after a week&#8217;s absence he turned
eastward again, escorting Annette Crane and her
two children to Washington, as he had suggested
to Crane.</p>

<p>For the purpose of acquiring knowledge of others
and of one&#8217;s self, there is nothing like a long railway
journey. Marriage itself is scarcely more of
an eye-opener. The old Greeks, who reasoned so
closely on the nature of man, would have been
vastly informed could they have taken a few long
journeys. Locke could have known more of the human
understanding had he taken the Chicago Limited,
with a party, from Chicago to Washington.
In that journey Annette Crane found out all about
Geoffrey Thorndyke, and Geoffrey Thorndyke
found out all about Annette Crane. Their mutual
discoveries changed the natural sympathy which
had been established between them to a deep and
lasting friendship.</p>

<p>Those five years of seclusion at Circleville had
been developing years for Annette Crane. In appearance
she had gained in dignity and had not
lost in youthfulness. She had fair hair and a wild-rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
complexion, and a pair of the sweetest, most
limpid hazel eyes in the world. Everything about
her bore the impress of a gentle sincerity&mdash;her
frank gaze, her pretty smile, her soft voice, in
which the Western burr was almost obliterated.
Those five years represented a cycle to her. In that
time all of her relations to life seemed to have
changed&mdash;and especially were her relations with
her husband curiously altered. In their early married
life Crane&#8217;s intensity of love and excess of devotion
had frightened her a little. But in time
other passions had come to take the place of this one
in his wife, and it had been shouldered out of place.
He was a fairly good husband, but after the microbe
has once lodged in a man&#8217;s brain that he is
very superior to his wife, he may still be called a
good husband, but scarcely an agreeable one.</p>

<p>At this stage of the proceedings&mdash;which was at
the time she first came to Washington&mdash;Annette
discovered that she adored her husband. As he had
always accused her of coldness and reserve, she determined
to show him all the treasures of her love.
It was the common mistake of youth and ignorance;
but Annette, whose secret pride was great, suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
a horrible mortification in finding that the
display of her affection did not bring forth the response
on which she had confidently relied. She
had made no moan, and had deceived the whole
world, including Crane himself, into believing that
she was a satisfied wife; but her misery had been
extreme. Her pride, informed by common-sense,
had helped her over the crisis. She had herself proposed
to spend the winters in Circleville, instead of
Washington, thus forestalling any possibility of
the proposal coming from Crane; and in Circleville
she had set herself the task of making the most
and best of herself, not only for her husband, but
for her children. She had learned a good deal in
that brief and unpleasant experience in Washington.
Among others was a just appreciation of herself.
She realised that she had certain great advantages,
and she no longer had the self-deprecatory
tone of mind which had made her feel that Crane
had perhaps condescended in marrying her. She
was as passionately attached to him as ever, but her
eyes were opened and she saw.</p>

<p>She had taken to reading as a solace, and as a
duty, and not because she was strongly attracted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
books. The result, however, was good, and she
found it enabled her to meet men like Thorndyke
on a common ground. In training her children, she
had performed the inevitable function of training
herself. Under her system, her children had become
quieter and sweeter than American children usually
are. The American women in general can more
than hold their own with the women of other countries,
except in two trifling particulars&mdash;the arts of
housekeeping and of bringing up children. In
these two things they generally fail egregiously,
and the more money they have the more conspicuous
is their failure. To paraphrase the Scripture&mdash;&#8220;See
you the house of the rich American man? Behold
therein a tribe of undisciplined and impudent
servants and children.&#8221; The newness of the rich in
America may account for the undisciplined servants,
of whom their mistresses are in mortal terror. But
American women have been bringing up children
ever since the settlement at Jamestown and the landing
of the Pilgrim Fathers, and every year they
seem to know less about it.</p>

<p>However, Annette Crane&#8217;s children were more
quiet, more simply dressed than most American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
children. They had escaped, to a great degree, the
demoralising influences of children&#8217;s magazines,
&#8220;The Children&#8217;s Page&#8221; in newspapers, and children&#8217;s
plays, and they had not been amused to death.
Annette, it is true, had not mastered the science of
managing servants, but in that she was at one with
the women of other parts of the country, except the
South&mdash;for, as Senator Hoar once remarked on the
floor of the Senate, as a preliminary to a ferocious
attack on the South, it is the Southerners alone,
in this country, who have the habit of command.
Annette Crane, however, although she could no more
manage her household staff of one maid-of-all-work
than Mrs. James Brentwood Baldwin or Mrs. Hill-Smith
could manage her retinue of English flunkeys
and French maids, yet, by tact and judgment,
succeeded in keeping the maid-of-all-work within
bounds&mdash;which is more than the Brentwood Baldwins
and the Hill-Smiths could do with their maids
and flunkeys.</p>

<p>On the journey with Thorndyke, not one word
had passed Annette&#8217;s lips to indicate any rift between
her husband and herself. She spoke of him
frankly and affectionately. But the two children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
showed none of that happy eagerness to meet their
father which the average American child shows to
meet a dutiful and obedient parent. This did not
escape Thorndyke, and amazed him. He had the
usual bachelor&#8217;s fear and dread of children, but
two days and nights of travel with little Roger and
Elizabeth Crane had placed him upon terms of perfect
intimacy with them. Roger had climbed all
over him, and Thorndyke, instead of resenting it,
had been secretly pleased at it. He had wrung permission
from Annette to take the boy into the smoking-car
with him occasionally, and Roger emerged
with many mannish airs for his eight years.
Thorndyke&#8217;s berth was at the other end of the
sleeper from Annette&#8217;s and her children, and on the
second night, when Thorndyke turned in, he found
the youngster had eluded his mother&#8217;s vigilant eye,
and had crawled into Thorndyke&#8217;s berth for a talk
about Indians. Thorndyke not only submitted to
this, but permitted Roger to send word to his mother
by the porter that he would sleep in Mr. Thorndyke&#8217;s
berth, because Mr. Thorndyke had asked
him&mdash;and the two of them managed to defy Annette
in the matter. Little Elizabeth took an extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
fancy to Thorndyke, and inquired if she might ask
Mr. Thorndyke to be her uncle Thorndyke.</p>

<p>Annette, being acute, as most women are, in affairs
of the heart, knew, the very first time that
Thorndyke casually mentioned Constance Maitland,
that he was in love with her. When he said
that he had known her long ago, at Lake Como, and
proceeded to describe the beauty of those Italian
days and nights, Annette Crane was convinced that
it was in those sweet hours that Thorndyke had first
loved Constance Maitland. Women have no conscience
in probing the love-affairs of men, reckoning
them the common property of the sex&mdash;and while
Thorndyke was blithely unconscious that he had revealed
anything, Annette was in full possession of
all the essential facts. Also, Thorndyke let out that
Crane knew Constance Maitland. Crane had never
mentioned Constance&#8217;s name to his wife. That, was
in itself enough to give Annette a painful interest
in this woman who, as Thorndyke said, could charm
the birds off the bushes.</p>

<p>When the train came bumping into Washington
on a pleasant May afternoon, Crane was waiting at
the station. He seemed delighted to meet his family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
again, and indeed, on seeing them, a kind of tenderness
came over him. He kissed his children affectionately,
to which they submitted. Just behind
them was a shabby, one-armed man, whom a girl of
ten or twelve was hugging and kissing with little
gurgles of delight. Crane wished that his children
had met him like that.</p>

<p>He thanked Thorndyke warmly for taking care
of Annette, who said a few words of earnest thanks,
and gave him a smile from her dewy lips and eyes
that meant much more. The children bade him
good-bye with outspoken regret, and would not be
comforted until Thorndyke promised to take them
to the Zoo the next Sunday to see the baby elephant.</p>

<p>As the party came out of the station together, a
handsome little victoria whirled by. In it sat Constance
Maitland, her delicate mauve draperies enveloping
her, a black lace parasol shading her head,
and a filmy white veil over her face. By her side
sat a little, withered old lady in rusty black&mdash;one
of the flotsam and jetsam of weary old people who
drift to Washington to die. It was one of Constance
Maitland&#8217;s pet charities to take these weary
old people to drive, and in so doing to wear her loveliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
gowns, her most exquisite hats&mdash;a delicate
compliment unfailingly appreciated.</p>

<p>She did not see Thorndyke and the Cranes as
they walked out of the station&mdash;but both men saw
her. Annette Crane had abundant confirmation of
her hypothesis about Thorndyke. His clear-cut,
but rather plain, features became almost handsome
as he watched the passing vision of the woman he
loved. Of far more interest to Annette was Crane&#8217;s
countenance. It was full of expression, and he was
totally untrained in controlling it. There was in his
eyes a strange and complex look, which Annette interpreted
instantly to mean, &#8220;You are the type of
woman I most admire and to whom I most aspire.&#8221;
It struck her to the heart, but, unlike Crane, she
had acquired an admirable composure which made
her mistress of herself. She was glad, however, that
Constance had not seen her first, after two days of
hard travel.</p>

<p>When the Cranes had reached the suburban villa
where Crane lived, a number of letters and despatches
were awaiting him. Two or three men,
Hardeman among them, came out that evening to
see him. From them Annette found out the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
struggle in which her husband was engaged. He
had scarcely mentioned it to her.</p>

<p>Not a word of inquiry or reproach from her followed.
When Crane, however, alluded to the great
fight some days afterward, he was a little staggered
to find that Annette knew as much about it as anybody.
A study of the newspaper files at the National
Library had enlightened her.</p>

<p>Thorndyke did not see Constance for some days
after his return; that is to say, he did not show
himself to her. But he resumed his nightly prowl in
her neighbourhood&mdash;a practice ridiculous or pathetic
according to the view one takes of an honourable
and sensitive man, whose honour stands between
him and the love of his life. He did not
dream that Constance knew of it, but the fact was
she had known of it from the very beginning. It
was this knowledge which made her somewhat sad
dark eyes grow bright, which brought out a delicate
flush upon her cheeks, and gave her step the
airy spring of her first girlhood. It is the glorious
privilege of love to restore their lost youth to those
who love. Constance knew, by an unerring instinct,
that Thorndyke, like herself, treasured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
everything of their past&mdash;that past, so ethereal, so
innocent, so dreamlike, but to them eternal as the
heavens. On the first evening after Thorndyke&#8217;s return,
when Constance, from her balcony, half-hidden
in towering palms, caught sight of the flame of
Thorndyke&#8217;s cigar as he strolled by in the murky
night, she slipped within the darkened drawing-room.
The next moment Thorndyke heard her
playing softly some chords of the old, old songs&mdash;nay,
even singing a stanza or two. It filled his heart
with a vehement hope that set his pulses off like
wild horses, into an ecstasy which lasted until he got
home to his old-fashioned bachelor quarters. What!
Ask Constance Maitland to give up her beautiful
home, her carriages, her French gowns for <i>that</i>!
Thorndyke called himself a blankety-blank fool,
with an emphasis that bordered on blasphemy.
Next day he was so dull that the Honourable Mark
Antony Hudgins charged him with having been
jilted by a certain tailor-made and Paris-enamelled
widow whom Thorndyke paid considerable attention
to and cordially hated. That very afternoon,
though, he had his recompense, for, strolling
through the beautiful but unfashionable Smithsonian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
grounds, he met Constance Maitland driving;
and in response to a timid request on his part,
she took him in the victoria, and they had a
delicious hour to themselves under the great, overhanging
elms and lindens. Few situations are more
agreeable than driving in a victoria with a charming
woman on a sunny spring afternoon through a
secluded park. Something like it may be experienced
by sitting in a darkened theatre-box a little
behind, and within touch of a dainty ear, inhaling
the odour of the flowers she wears upon her breast,
and watching, with her, the development of the old
love-story on the stage. But all pleasures have their
seasons&mdash;and in the spring, the victoria is more enticing
than the theatre-box. And Constance was so
very, very kind to him that afternoon!</p>

<p>She showed a truly feminine curiosity about Annette
Crane, whom Thorndyke praised unstintedly,
and when he asked Constance to call on Mrs. Crane,
Constance replied that she already intended to do
so. She asked about Crane&#8217;s political prospects,
which Thorndyke assured her were of the brightest,
adding he had grave apprehensions that the
majority in the lower House would not, after all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
make fools of themselves as he ardently desired they
should&mdash;which sentiment was promptly rebuked
by Constance, who, womanlike, never could be
made to really understand the game of politics.
Then he asked her what she had been doing in
that week. She had been out to a suburban
club to a dinner given by Cathcart, at which information
Thorndyke scowled. Sir Mark le Poer was
coming back to town for a few days, expressly, so
Constance believed, to see the Honourable Mark
Antony Hudgins, of Texas. The meeting of the
Guild for Superannuated Governesses had taken
place at the house of the Secretary of State, Mrs.
Hill-Smith in the chair, and had been extremely
amusing. It had been determined to give an amateur
concert in a fashionable hotel ball-room. This,
as always, had caused many heart-burnings and
bickerings. The concert was to be followed by a tea
in the same ball-room. All of the prominent ladies
of the diplomatic corps had been asked to act as patronesses,
and all had agreed, but were not sure they
could be present. Some ladies of great wealth,
who were even newer than the Baldwins, came rather
aggressively to the front. Mrs. Hill-Smith, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
other scions of old families of her date&mdash;1860&mdash;thought
that no one whose family was not moderately
old&mdash;that is to say about 1870&mdash;should be
among the directors and patronesses. They did not
speak this aloud, but there was a general knowledge
prevailing of the period when the various ladies had
emerged from having &#8220;help&#8221; to the stage of having
servants&mdash;when they had changed the two-o&#8217;clock
dinner to the eight-o&#8217;clock function. Each of these
ladies knew all about the others, but hugged the delusion
that the others did not know about them, or
thought, as Eleanor Baldwin did, that they had
come of a long line of belted earls, the Hogans included.
Mrs. Baldwin, handsomer, haughtier-looking,
and more silent than usual, listened to what was
said. Constance Maitland&mdash;she alone, who fathomed
the nature of this misunderstood woman&mdash;said,
in describing it to Thorndyke, that she believed
Mrs. Baldwin realised the nonsense of the proceedings
better than any one present. Constance&#8217;s
eyes danced when she told about the way in which
her only suggestion was received&mdash;that it would be
impossible to find any parallel between the conditions
of governesses in England and the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
States. This, however, was ruthlessly brushed aside
by a lady who was determined that her daughter
should sing a duet at the concert with a member of
the Austrian Embassy staff. For the first time Mrs.
Baldwin&#8217;s voice was heard and in it quiet advocacy
of something sensible. This was when it was determined
to charge a stupendous price for the tickets.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it seems to me
that we ought to have some real music. It doesn&#8217;t
seem quite right to charge the price asked to hear
good music, and then give a mere amateur performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is for charity!&#8221; screamed several ladies
in chorus.</p>

<p>Then Constance, still with dancing eyes, told that
great stress had been laid upon the alleged opinions
of various ladies of the diplomatic corps, who had
carefully refrained from expressing any opinions
at all and were not present to take care of themselves;
and Constance had landed a second bombshell
in the camp by pleading ignorance of many
admirable things, owing to her ill-fortune in being
educated chiefly in Europe. This remark necessitated
an immediate departure, in which she was followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
by Mrs. Baldwin. The two going out together,
Mrs. Baldwin had said diffidently to Constance:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Maitland&mdash;I&mdash;I think you are right in
all you have said to-day. I hope you&#8217;ll come to see
me soon. I don&#8217;t seem to be afraid of you&mdash;you&#8217;re
genuine. You&#8217;re never pretending to anything.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin had not the gift of tongues, but,
as Constance said, a compliment from Mrs. Baldwin
was of value, no matter how awkwardly it was
expressed.</p>

<p>A few afternoons later, Constance drove out to
the Cranes&#8217; suburban villa, but Mrs. Crane was not
at home. Constance was disappointed&mdash;her curiosity
to see Crane&#8217;s wife was unabated. Ten days
afterward, on a warm afternoon, Constance sat in
her cool drawing-room, fresh in its summer dress of
linen covers, bead porti&egrave;res, and shaded by awnings,
waiting for her carriage. Mrs. Crane was announced.
The first impression which Constance got
of Annette Crane was that she was exquisitely
dressed. Her gown was a delicate, pale-blue muslin,
her hat, a white straw, trimmed with white ribbons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Both gown and hat were of her own creation, and
the whole outfit had cost less than ten dollars&mdash;but
not the greatest man-milliner in Paris ever turned
out anything more becoming to Annette&#8217;s simple
and natural beauty than she herself had evolved
from the &#8220;Emporium&#8221; at Circleville. The daintiness
and freshness of it was charming; and when,
in moving, she accidentally displayed a snowy, lace-edged
petticoat, this daintiness and freshness was
emphasised.</p>

<p>Never in her life had Annette looked forward to
a visit with the same dislike as this one. Crane had at
last spoken of Constance Maitland, saying he meant
to ask her to call. He was very guarded in all he
said, but Annette, as would any intelligent wife, saw
that he was on his guard, and that, in itself, told
much. She said nothing; she was far above the
spites of petty jealousy. She no longer depreciated
herself in general, but she had been a little frightened
by Thorndyke&#8217;s praises of Constance Maitland&#8217;s
intelligence and charm. And Annette had,
by clairvoyance, come very near to Crane&#8217;s real feeling
for Constance. It was not love&mdash;she had begun
miserably to doubt whether he were really capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
of love&mdash;but it was a degree of admiration which
could not be agreeable to any wife, because it was
plain that Constance was the standard by which
Crane measured women. Constance could at any
moment influence Crane; so Annette justly surmised.
No woman of sense objects to her husband&#8217;s
simple admiration of another woman, but
when it comes to another woman being a factor in
his life and his thoughts, a wife must and should
resent it.</p>

<p>So it was that Annette disliked the visit she had
to pay, and yet was careful not to postpone it. But
by some magic of thought and feeling, the instant
she came face to face with Constance Maitland, Annette
Crane knew she had a friend. In a moment
she was at ease. Like a woman of the world in the
best sense, Constance at once found something in
common to talk about, and the two sat, in the friendliest
conversation possible, each singularly pleased
with the other.</p>

<p>Seeing Constance dressed to go out, and the victoria
standing at the door, Annette, after paying a
short visit, rose to go, and with more reluctance
than she had thought possible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;If you are returning home, perhaps you will allow
me to drive you out,&#8221; said Constance, affably,
and Annette accepted without any demurs.</p>

<p>Seated together in the carriage, the conversation
between the two turned on Thorndyke. Annette expressed
frankly the deep regard she had for him,
and described her efforts to keep the children from
annoying him, while Thorndyke, from simple tolerance
of them at first, had become an accomplished
child-spoiler and destroyer of parental discipline.
Constance spoke of Thorndyke as frankly and without
the least embarrassment, but Annette, who had
surmised very readily where Constance stood in the
regard of two men, one of them her own husband,
had little difficulty in settling to her own satisfaction
that Miss Maitland had a particular regard
for Mr. Thorndyke.</p>

<p>After driving for three-quarters of an hour along
a suburban road, they came to the cottage where
the Cranes had established their quarters. It was
near six o&#8217;clock, and Crane had returned early
from the Capitol. He was sitting on the veranda
reading to Roger and Elizabeth when Constance
Maitland&#8217;s carriage drove up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Since the meeting with his children and noting
their perfectly respectful, but perfectly evident, indifference
toward him, Crane had received a blow
where he least expected it. He was surprised at the
degree to which it affected him. Their laughing
eyes, suddenly growing demure on his approach,
haunted him amid the hurly-burly of debate, and in
long conferences on his political future. Impelled
by all the natural impulses, Crane determined to try
and win his children&#8217;s hearts; and as a beginning,
he had come home early from the House that day,
bringing with him a book to read to them. The
reading had been a success, and in the midst of it
Crane looked up and saw the victoria approaching
with his wife and Constance Maitland in it. He
rose at once and walked down the shady path to
where the carriage stood. The children, hand in
hand, followed after, blowing kisses to their mother.</p>

<p>Crane was so possessed with the idea that Annette,
as a native of Circleville, must be far inferior
to Constance, that he had a shock of surprise when
he saw the two women actually compared, and realised
that Annette was by no means cast into the
shade. Constance was conscious of this, but good-naturedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
wished Annette to have the benefit
of it.</p>

<p>Crane talked pleasantly with Constance for a few
minutes, Annette still sitting in the carriage. He
was certainly remarkably handsome, as the declining
sun shone on his clear-cut, olive face, with the
little rings of dark-brown hair showing on his forehead.
Constance thought the Cranes the handsomest
couple she had seen for a long time. The
children were introduced, behaved well, as American,
and especially Western, children seldom do&mdash;and
then Constance said to Annette:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall soon be closing my house for the season,
but before doing so, I hope to have you and Mr.
Crane to dinner with me some evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will come with pleasure,&#8221; replied Annette;
and a date was arranged for the following week.</p>

<p>Constance returned to town, thinking to herself
what a fool Crane must be not to be satisfied with
such a wife as Annette.</p>

<small>CONCERNING THINGS NOT TO BE MENTIONED IN
THE SOCIETY JOURNALS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The days went rapidly by for Crane, to whom
they were full of events. The House committed
fewer follies than might have been expected, and
the management of the international crisis had put
the country into a thoroughly good humour with
both the House and the Administration. Crane
gained steadily in consequence among the politicians,
and it was with difficulty he kept his head;
but he kept it.</p>

<p>He did not relax his efforts to win his children&#8217;s
hearts, and in the effort he began to feel a strange
jealousy of Thorndyke, who had won them without
any effort at all. Thorndyke had not only taken
Roger and Elizabeth to the Zoo on the first Sunday,
but on the next he had appeared, looking extremely
sheepish, and had requested the pleasure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
their company to the Zoo again. The children were
in paroxysms of delight, and Annette laughed outright
at Thorndyke, particularly when he admitted
that he had declined an invitation to a breakfast at
the Brentwood Baldwins on the ground of a previous
engagement in order to carry out this little
trip to the Zoo. The trio went off together in great
spirits, and Crane and Annette were left alone.
Through all the laughing and joking with the children,
Crane had sat silent and sombre&mdash;they had
not yet laughed and joked with him. Suddenly,
he proposed a walk to Annette. It was so long since
such a thing had occurred that he was embarrassed
in giving the invitation, and she in accepting it;
but they walked together along the country lanes in
the quiet Sunday noon, and a shadow of the old confidence
was restored between them. But Crane was
still fully convinced that Annette was not cut out
for the wife of a public man, and could not shine in
cosmopolitan society. He was soon to have an
opportunity to judge of her in this last particular.</p>

<p>Constance Maitland had set her mind to work
upon that difficult and interesting problem&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
composition of a small dinner. More than that, she
meant it to be one at which Annette would be at her
best.</p>

<p>The materials to form a good dinner abound in
Washington, and Constance Maitland knew it. As
the smart set in Washington is composed largely
of persons who have made large fortunes in trade,
and who have come to Washington to enjoy these
fortunes, Constance knew that from this particular
element she could not well draw the material for a
really sparkling dinner. The people in Europe
know something after all, and their dictum that an
elegant and brilliant society cannot be constructed
out of retired merchants has not yet been disproved.
Let us be candid to ourselves. But in Washington
the materials for a real society exist outside of this
element, and Constance Maitland had been lucky
enough to find it. Sir Mark le Poer was in town
again, which Constance reckoned as a special Providence.
Like all Englishmen of good position, Sir
Mark was bored within an inch of his life by the
Anglo-American girl, who is an easily detected imitation.
Constance, having been a friend of Sir
Mark&#8217;s for many years, and knowing him like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
book, spared him this infliction. She selected in the
construction of the party Mrs. Willoughby, an accomplished
Washington woman, whose family had
social antecedents dating back to the days of Abigail
Adams. Mrs. Willoughby had been a distinguished
hostess for twenty years, until the influx of
pork, whiskey, dry-goods, and the like commodities
had overwhelmed everything to the manner born.
She took it all good-naturedly, and got a great deal
of amusement out of the status quo. Then there
was Mary Beekman, of New York, young, charming,
and rich, whose parents had owned a box at the
New York Academy of Music, but who were conspicuously
out of it with the Metropolitan Opera
set. As Mrs. Willoughby remarked, when Constance
mentioned the party she had made up:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a very interesting collection of has-beens
you have got together, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the men, besides Crane and Sir Mark le Poer,
Constance had secured Thorndyke, an admirable
dinner-man, and a courtly old Admiral&mdash;for she
was quite unlike the widow of a prominent shoe-dealer,
who emigrated to Washington and became
violently fashionable, and who declared that on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
visiting list she &#8220;drew the line at the army and
navy.&#8221; On the evening of the dinner there was to
be a belated reception at the White House, in honour
of an international commission which had just
opened its sittings in Washington, and it was arranged
that the dinner should be somewhat early,
that the whole party, being invited to the White
House, might adjourn there.</p>

<p>The rest of the guests were assembled in Constance&#8217;s
drawing-room before the Cranes arrived.
Crane himself always looked superbly handsome
in evening-clothes, and Annette&#8217;s appearance was
scarcely inferior in another way. As on her first
meeting with Constance, Annette gave the impression
of being exquisitely gowned. A simple white
cr&ecirc;pe, cut low, showed off her beautiful arms and
shoulders, and a few moss rosebuds in their green
leaves gave the needed touch of colour to her costume.
Simplicity is always the last form of elegance
to be attained, and Annette Crane had attained
it.</p>

<p>Constance Maitland, too, was at her best, in a
shimmering black gown, like a starry night, and
with her grandmother&#8217;s pearl necklace around her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
white throat. Mrs. Willoughby, with resplendent
black eyes and snow-white hair, looked like one of
Sir Peter Lely&#8217;s court of beauties, and Mary Beekman
was pretty enough to shine anywhere.</p>

<p>When they were seated around the table the men
secretly congratulated themselves on the looks of
the women with whom they were to dine; and
Thorndyke voiced this opinion by quoting Oliver
Wendell Holmes&#8217;s suggestion that peas and potatoes
could be warmed into an early fruition by surrounding
them with a ring of handsome women&mdash;such
as were then present&mdash;which caused the ladies
all to beam on him.</p>

<p>Annette, seated between the Admiral and Sir
Mark le Poer, with Thorndyke&#8217;s kind eyes across the
table to encourage her, and with Constance Maitland&#8217;s
fine gift as a hostess to sustain her, felt perfectly
at ease. Such was not the case with Crane
himself. It was the first time he had ever dined at
Constance Maitland&#8217;s house, and he yearned to distinguish
himself. He wished the conversation would
turn on public affairs; he felt he could easily lay
them all under a spell then, forgetting that people
don&#8217;t go out to dinner to be spellbound, but to enjoy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
an idle hour, and to exchange those pleasant freedoms
and trifles which make up the sum of recreation.</p>

<p>The Admiral, a white-moustached, charming old
man, who had hobnobbed with princes, and was none
the worse for it, began to compliment Annette on
her gown, after having previously called her &#8220;my
dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that gown is a most stunning
creation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorndyke chimed in here:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It makes Mrs. Crane look like
a white narcissus blooming in a bed of mignonette.&#8221;</p>

<p>No woman is ever disconcerted by compliments,
and Annette was charmed at the praises lavished on
her&mdash;and particularly in Crane&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say,&#8221; remarked Sir Mark le Poer, &#8220;with
my feeble powers of comparison, that Mrs. Crane&#8217;s
gown reminds me of some of your delicious American
dishes, not all sauces and flavourings like our
European things, but fresh and new and exquisite.
I know I have a grovelling nature, but, &#8217;pon my
soul, is there anything more charming than a dish
of delicate soft crabs on a bed of parsley&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; cried Constance. &#8220;How your soul
must grovel! However, it&#8217;s the highest compliment
Sir Mark can pay you, Mrs. Crane, because I know
he has an unholy passion for soft crabs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will pay you the highest compliment of all,&#8221;
said Mrs. Willoughby, &#8220;I will ask you, who is
your dressmaker?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made this gown myself,&#8221; answered Annette,
with a pretty smile.</p>

<p>Crane thought he should have gone through the
floor into the cellar. He had never in his life felt
such a rage of shame. There was Constance Maitland
in a gown that shouted out its French nationality
in every line and fold. Mrs. Willoughby and
Miss Beekman wore the smartest of smart creations&mdash;probably
not one of them had ever done a stitch
of sewing in their lives, while here was Annette announcing
that she made her own gown! The next
thing he expected her to proclaim was that she had
just completed six suits of pajamas for him, all
made with her own hands and feet, on her own sewing-machine
at Circleville.</p>

<p>Three persons at the table&mdash;Thorndyke, Constance,
and Annette herself&mdash;saw how annoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Crane was at what he regarded as a very damaging
admission. Annette, however, was quite composed.
She saw that instead of making a mistake she had
really made a hit, for she was more complimented
than ever upon her cleverness in making so beautiful
a gown. In truth, the sweet and natural way in
which she owned to her handiwork completed the
charm of her simple and unaffected personality.
Mrs. Willoughby, turning despairingly to the other
women, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are simply outclassed. Every man here
thinks that all of us, like Mrs. Crane, could make
our own gowns if only we were clever enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always thought,&#8221; said Thorndyke, smiling,
&#8220;that Napoleon&#8217;s idea of the education of women
was probably right&mdash;a plenty of religion and
needle-work. However, as I may get myself in
trouble, I will say no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very properly,&#8221; replied Constance, who meant
to enlighten Crane on his wife&#8217;s accomplishments.
&#8220;I have a great deal of religion, when I am not
annoyed by anything, and I beg all of the gentlemen
to observe that even if I were clever enough to
make a gown like Mrs. Crane&#8217;s, I could not wear it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
It is too well adapted to Mrs. Crane&#8217;s style for any
one else to venture on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could have worn it thirty years ago,&#8221; said
Mrs. Willoughby, with dangerous candour. &#8220;But
the fact is, Miss Maitland, all of these men are so
absurdly prejudiced in favour of the gown, that
they overrate it. After all, the rest of us are fairly
well-dressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annette took all this in the spirit of playful compliment
in which it was meant, and was flattered by
it. Not so Crane. He thought that Annette had,
at first, let an ugly cat out of the bag, and secondly,
that Mrs. Willoughby was insolent in saying the
gown was overrated. But before the dinner was
over, his eyes were opened to the fact that Annette
had made a most agreeable impression, and every
man present admired her, and every woman present
liked her.</p>

<p>As soon as the rather short dinner was through,
the carriages were called to take the party to the
White House. When Crane and Annette were alone
in their cab, he said to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me you made a bad break in saying
you made your gown yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;Far from it,&#8221; replied Annette, pleasantly. &#8220;It
seems to have made them all like me better. Mrs.
Willoughby and Miss Beekman both said they would
be glad to call to see me, and so did the Admiral. I
think I was a success.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane felt like rubbing his eyes and pulling his
ears. Was this his submissive Annette, who never
questioned his word on any subject? He half expected
her to call attention to the fact that he had
been rather dull at the dinner, but although Annette
knew it quite as well as he did, she forbore to mention
it.</p>

<p>When they reached the White House, there was
the usual crowd of carriages, their lamps twinkling
like myriads of stars in the soft spring night, the
roar of horses&#8217; hoofs upon the asphalt, the crowds
of gaily dressed women in evening-gowns disembarking
at the north portico, the blare of music
from the red-coated band within the corridors. Constance
Maitland, on Sir Mark le Poer&#8217;s arm, and
followed by her dinner-guests, presently found herself
shaking hands with the President and bowing
to the line of ladies of the Administration, which
extended across the oval reception-room. Next the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
President&#8217;s wife stood the wife of the Secretary of
State. She was a small, thin woman, with a determined
nose and the general aspect of a medi&aelig;val
battle-axe. She was simply though splendidly attired
in black velvet, with lace and diamonds, and
was as faultlessly correct as the Secretary himself,
in language and deportment, except in one small
particular&mdash;she could not pronounce the word
&#8220;Something.&#8221; She invariably called it &#8220;su&#8217;thin&#8221;&mdash;a
souvenir of her early bringing up on the banks of
Lake Michigan. She greeted Constance coolly, remembering
the meeting at her house for the Guild
of Superannuated Governesses, but she was effusive
toward Sir Mark le Poer.</p>

<p>Constance, however, blandly unconscious, passed
on, and when she reached the point whence ingress
is had to that select region known as &#8220;behind the
line,&#8221; she was invited, with Sir Mark, to join the
elect. Directly behind her was Thorndyke with
Mary Beekman, followed by the Admiral with Mrs.
Willoughby, and they, too, were invited within the
holy precincts. The President himself had stopped
Crane for a word with him, and, on having Mrs.
Crane presented, had promptly invited her behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
the line. This was partly due to the white cr&ecirc;pe
gown.</p>

<p>In the general mix-up that followed in the hallowed
spot, Constance found herself one of a group
near Mrs. Hill-Smith, on the arm of the British Ambassador,
and Eleanor Baldwin and the Honourable
Edward George Francis Castlestuart-Stuart.
Close by were Mrs. James Brentwood Baldwin and
Mr. James Brentwood Baldwin, and Mr. James
Brentwood Baldwin was gravitating toward the Secretary
of State, who loomed large at hand. The
Secretary was in a very bad humour for so amiable
a man, but diplomatically concealed it. After
eighteen months spent in labouring over a couple of
treaties, they had been knocked out in three weeks
by the Senate. The chief of the gang who perpetrated
this nefarious act was a Southern Senator&mdash;the
wildest, woolliest, and weirdest of all the wild
and woolly and weird Senators to be found in the
north wing of the Capitol. But he happened
to be a lawyer, and he had punched the treaties
so full of holes that they were literally laughed out
of court. This injured the Secretary&#8217;s feelings
very much, but he remembered that Beaconsfield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
and Gortschakoff and Bismarck used to be ruffled
the same way, so he concluded to bear it like a
statesman and a Christian.</p>

<p>Drifting toward the Secretary and Mr. Baldwin
was a very odd-looking object, whom Thorndyke
whispered to Constance was Senator Mince Pie
Mulligan. These three got into conversation, very
languid on the part of the Secretary and Mr. James
Brentwood Baldwin, but very strenuous on the part
of Senator Mince Pie Mulligan. A part of Mr.
James Brentwood Baldwin&#8217;s coyness came from the
fact that he and Senator Mulligan were old acquaintances&mdash;a
fact which Mr. Baldwin had no disposition
to brag about.</p>

<p>The new Senator had a head of blazing red hair
which was as good as a stove on a cold night. He
might have stepped bodily from the pages of <i>Life</i>
as regarded his contours, but his small, light-blue
eye glittered with humour and shrewdness, while his
great, slit of a mouth, which divided his face fairly
in the middle, had lines of both sense and kindliness.
He was enjoying himself hugely, and was not afraid
to let anybody see it. Not so Mr. James Brentwood
Baldwin, or the Secretary of State, but a Senator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
is a Senator to the Secretary of State, and Secretary
Slater had in mind other treaties to be laid before
the Senate, and so was fairly civil to Senator
Mulligan. Mince Pie, himself, was much struck by
the appearance of Eleanor Baldwin, who was easily
the handsomest woman present, except her mother,
but although Mr. James Brentwood Baldwin owned
up that Eleanor was his daughter, he made no move
to introduce Senator Mulligan to her.</p>

<p>Eleanor Baldwin was a patriot. It was her sense
of patriotic duty alone which took her to a White
House reception. White House receptions, in every
particular, including the cabinet people and those
behind the line, were &#8220;mixed.&#8221; This word &#8220;mixed&#8221;
meant, to Eleanor, a social Gehenna, while the word
&#8220;exclusive&#8221; spelled, for her, the very joy of living.
There were some &#8220;nice people&#8221;&mdash;by whom she meant
the diplomatic corps and those who were intimate
with them, and some people from the smart sets of
near-by cities&mdash;but still it was &#8220;mixed.&#8221; There was
Letty Standiford, whose father, had Eleanor but
known it, was personally responsible for the present
occupant of the White House being there. Then
she noticed, quite close to her, the daughter of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Senator who lived in a very unfashionable part of
the town&mdash;a girl whom she would never have known,
except that paying calls one day, with Mrs. Hill-Smith,
she happened to go to the Senator&#8217;s house.
It had contained for her the one unattainable thing
in life&mdash;some fine old furniture and portraits, and
a beautiful old grandfather&#8217;s clock, which had been
inherited, and by which the Senator&#8217;s daughter had
not seemed to set any special store. Eleanor would
have given all of their costly bric-&agrave;-brac for one
single piece of old silver or furniture or lace that
had belonged even so far back as to her grandparents;
but neither the Baldwins nor the Hogans
had inherited any silver, furniture, or lace, or anything
except good, strong legs and arms, and the
capacity to use them. The sight of family treasures
always produced a vague discomfort in Eleanor
Baldwin&#8217;s mind, and gave her a kind of pique toward
those who possessed them. At that very moment
she felt a secret dislike toward the Senator&#8217;s
daughter, who had on a beautiful antique lace bertha,
which had been worn by many generations of
ladies before the Brentwood Baldwins had &#8220;arrived,&#8221;
as the French say. There had been a fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
in the Baldwin family, and likewise one in the Hogan
family, and Eleanor had persuaded herself
that the frame houses burnt down in these two fires
were stately mansions, and priceless family treasures
had perished in the flames&mdash;and she had hinted
at this so often that she had really come to believe
it. She was surprised to see that her father and
also the Secretary of State were talking with that
curious-looking object, Senator Mulligan, whose
name she had heard. But seeing the British Ambassador
approach with Mrs. Hill-Smith on his arm,
and Constance Maitland with Sir Mark le Poer,
Eleanor turned her whole attention to them. She,
too, had brought dinner-guests with her. She had
been the hostess at one of those extraordinary dinners
introduced within the last few years by hostesses
whose experience of dinner-giving is rudimentary.
At these dinners, which are considered
by their innocent perpetrators as being the
acme of elegance, all the men are foreigners. When
Eleanor Baldwin had achieved one of these dinners,
she felt that she had accomplished a social triumph.
Mrs. Hill-Smith had chaperoned the dinner; and the
diplomats invited had refrained from laughing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
the face of their hostess, although they had chuckled
with amusement when in the dressing-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin, who stood in the background, wore
more than her usual expression of icy pride, which
meant that she was more than usually frightened.
Eleanor&#8217;s lovely face relaxed into a smile as she
turned to the British Ambassador, who was a widower.
He was a tall, handsome, high-bred-looking, elderly
man, with a clean-shaven face, and a thin-lipped
mouth, which had contorted itself into a grin
on his first arrival in Washington, and the grin had
become fixed and perpetual. He had no fortune beyond
his salary and pension, he had rheumatism,
liver complaint, nervous dyspepsia, chronic bronchitis,
and a family of six unmarried daughters and
four sons, ranging from thirty-six to sixteen years
of age&mdash;yet Eleanor Baldwin would have jumped
down his throat, and Mrs. Hill-Smith was going for
him with the stealthy energy of a cat after the
cream-jug.</p>

<p>Eleanor, putting on a roguish expression of
countenance, said to the Ambassador:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mrs. Hill-Smith and I are becoming factors
in diplomacy! At our dinner to-night, every man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
present was a diplomat, and you may imagine
what state secrets were disclosed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The results may be serious,&#8221; replied the Ambassador,
laughing a little. &#8220;We shall have to keep
our eyes upon the American diplomats who were
present so as to find out how our secrets were betrayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There weren&#8217;t any Americans present,&#8221; answered
Eleanor, gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; said the Ambassador, pretending to be
deaf.</p>

<p>Eleanor repeated her words a little louder. There
was Constance Maitland near enough to hear, and
like Mrs. Hill-Smith, Eleanor was a little afraid of
Constance Maitland, and also of Mr. Thorndyke,
who had an uncomfortable way of laughing at very
serious matters; and just at her elbow was that
queer Castlestuart-Stuart, who blurted out things,
such as not liking books, which other people kept to
themselves; and it was this British bull which now
proceeded to play havoc in the china-shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, with an air of infantine innocence,
and addressing his chief boldly. &#8220;It&#8217;s positively
true. Not a blessed American man there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
Never saw such a thing anywhere in my life before.
Fancy giving a dinner in London to foreign diplomats
and not having an Englishman there&mdash;haw!
haw!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Eleanor and Mrs. Hill-Smith turned pale.
Constance Maitland laughed outright; the Ambassador
and Sir Mark le Poer looked gravely into
each other&#8217;s eyes, and telegraphed, without winking,
their amusement. Castlestuart-Stuart kept
on.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Hachette, the new French third secretary,
told us in the dressing-room about a letter he had
got from his mother in Paris&mdash;terribly strict old
lady. She said, &#8216;You have written me about going
to dinners where no American men are present. You
are deceiving your old mother. It is impossible
that persons such as you describe us giving those
dinners should not know any respectable American
men. At all events, do not bring me back a daughter-in-law
who has no acquaintance among respectable
men in her own country&#8217;&mdash;haw! haw!
haw!&#8221;</p>

<p>A flood of colour poured into the faces of Eleanor
Baldwin and Mrs. Hill-Smith. The Ambassador&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
chronic grin had become a little broader; Sir Mark
le Poer was tugging at his moustache. That impossible
person, Castlestuart-Stuart, was haw-hawing
with the keenest enjoyment. Constance Maitland
felt that it was time to come to the rescue of
her country even at the sacrifice of her country-women&mdash;so,
smiling openly, she said to the too
truthful Castlestuart-Stuart:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t blame you for laughing&mdash;it makes all
the initiated laugh. But you must see for yourself
that it is only the newest of the new who do such
things. All people new to society do strange
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never saw it done anywhere before, &#8217;pon my
soul,&#8221; replied this incorrigible Briton. &#8220;We have
our new people at home&mdash;tea, whiskey, drapery,
and furniture shops&mdash;and rawer than you can think&mdash;but
they wouldn&#8217;t dare&mdash;haw, haw! to give a dinner
without an Englishman at it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Constance bit her lip&mdash;Castlestuart-Stuart was
telling the truth, and there was no gainsaying it;
nor could she offer any fuller explanation than she
had already given. Mrs. Hill-Smith and Eleanor
Baldwin were glaring at her, but Constance remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
calm and unmoved. Then from a most
unexpected quarter came a terrible complication.
Mince Pie Mulligan, having been frozen out by the
Secretary of State and by Mr. James Brentwood
Baldwin, had been jammed by the crowd almost
in Eleanor Baldwin&#8217;s arms, without the least resistance
on his part, and had been an open-mouthed
and delighted listener to Castlestuart-Stuart&#8217;s candid
words. At the first break he proceeded to improve
his opportunities by hurling himself into the
conversation, and looking straight into Eleanor&#8217;s
eyes the Senator bawled to Castlestuart-Stuart:</p>

<p>&#8220;To give such heathenish dinners as you say,
people have got not only to be new, but they have
got to be blamed fools besides!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s awful pause, and then an
involuntary burst of laughter from all except Mrs.
Hill-Smith and Eleanor Baldwin. The functions
of society with them meant deadly serious things,
such as baking and washing days had been to their
grandmothers, and they thought one about as little
a subject of a joke as the other. Eleanor Baldwin
drew herself up, and looked coldly at the
British Ambassador, whose mouth had certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
grown wider. Mrs. Hill-Smith, who was really
timid, felt frightened to death. Like Eleanor Baldwin,
she had thought it the acme of elegance to
have a dinner where every man present was a foreigner
and a diplomat, and secretly regretted that,
from motives of state, there always had to be
Americans at a cabinet house. And here were the
diplomats themselves laughing at her! It was exquisitely
painful.</p>

<p>However, something more painful still was in
store for Eleanor Baldwin. Mrs. Baldwin approached
the group, and at sight of her Mr. Mulligan
held out his hand, and a broad smile carried
the corners of his mouth back to his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Nora Hogan,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;it&#8217;s good for
sore eyes to see you. I haven&#8217;t seen you before for
twenty-five years. Jim Baldwin didn&#8217;t tell me, just
now when I was talking with him, that you were
here, and didn&#8217;t introduce me to his daughter,
though I gave him some pretty broad hints. Sure,
you know Mike Mulligan, who was clerk in your
father&#8217;s store thirty years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I do, Mike,&#8221; responded Mrs. Baldwin,
calmly and sweetly and offering her hand. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
the first time Constance Maitland had ever seen
Mrs. Baldwin unbend from her cold stateliness.</p>

<p>The kindness of her greeting seemed to inspire
Senator Mulligan with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;A better man than your father, Dan Hogan,
never lived,&#8221; proclaimed Mr. Mulligan, addressing
the circle, &#8220;and it&#8217;s the training I got with him
that&#8217;s made my fortune. &#8216;Dale square, Mike,&#8217; Dan
Hogan would say&mdash;he had a beautiful brogue on
him&mdash;&#8216;and give the widders and the orphans the
turn of the scale when you&#8217;re sellin&#8217; &#8217;em sugar and
starch and such.&#8217; And I&#8217;ve done it, Nora, in memory
of good old Dan Hogan&mdash;and if any man says
it&#8217;s impossible to keep a corner grocery and be honest,
I say to &#8217;em&mdash;&#8216;It&#8217;s Danny Hogan, it is, that
was the honest man and kept the corner grocery.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin&#8217;s face grew softer and softer as
Mr. Mulligan proceeded. She was so great a lover
of charity and had such beautiful humility of spirit
that the idea of her father&#8217;s example having
moulded a man into a like charity gave her the deepest
gratitude and pleasure; and if pride had owned
a lodgment in her heart she would have been proud
at that moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>But not so Eleanor, or Mr. James Brentwood
Baldwin, who now appeared hovering on the edge
of the group. Eleanor, her face very pale, fixed her
eyes on Senator Mulligan with a haughty stare,
which he perfectly understood, and resented. A
gleam shot into his eye which showed that he meant
to pay her back for her insolence. Mr. Baldwin,
in the most acute misery, practised the goose-step
and tried to stem the tide of Senator Mulligan&#8217;s eloquence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;ah&mdash;eh&mdash;Mr. Mulligan, your compliments
to the late Mr. Daniel Hogan are very much appreciated
by me, as well as Mrs. Baldwin&mdash;especially
as I recall with pleasure&mdash;what an&mdash;er&mdash;important&mdash;er&mdash;factor
you were in the commerce of our native
place. For myself, business has no real charm
for me,&#8221; continued Mr. Baldwin, turning to the
British Ambassador. &#8220;I have been reasonably successful,
but my taste always lay in the way of
books. I live among my books.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up to this time Mr. Mulligan had spoken with a
very fair Irish accent, but now he chose to lapse into
the most violent brogue that ever grew on the green
sod of Ireland. This was accompanied with a wink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
to Constance, which gave her extreme enjoyment,
and a nudge in the Ambassador&#8217;s ribs, which he did
not in the least resent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, and it&#8217;s the way yez always was, Jim
Baldwin,&#8221; cried Mince Pie Mulligan. &#8220;Whin you
an&#8217; me was luggin&#8217; the buckets of butter an&#8217; jugs
of the most iligant molasses to th&#8217; cushtomers, it
was you, Jim Baldwin, as was always a-savin&#8217; your
tin cints to buy a book. An&#8217; when you was a-coortin&#8217;
Dan Hogan&#8217;s pretty daughter, ye&#8217;d actually
mourn over the ice-cream ye filled her up wid bekase
it wasn&#8217;t books wid a gilt bindin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Mulligan squared himself off,
and distributed a general wink around the circle,
including Eleanor, who glared at him like a basilisk.
Mrs. Hill-Smith felt acutely for her dear Eleanor,
but, being secretly consumed with curiosity about
antecedents as new to her as they were to Constance
Maitland, could not forbear remaining. The Slaters
were well established socially and financially at
the time of Mrs. Hill-Smith&#8217;s birth, and she was as
innocent of the phase of American life which Senator
Mulligan was describing as if she had been born
and reared in the royal apartments of Windsor Castle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Rochefoucauld has said there is something
not unpleasant to us in the misfortunes of our best
friends&mdash;and it was certainly true of Mrs. Hill-Smith&mdash;for
while she was eyeing Eleanor Baldwin
with an expression of the tenderest sympathy, she
was inwardly rejoicing that there was no blot of
butter or molasses upon the escutcheon of the Slaters.
But a relentless fate seemed to direct Senator
Mulligan&#8217;s tongue, and turning to her the Senator
said, cheerfully, and without the least encouragement:</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m tould ye are the granddaughter of
Cap&#8217;n Josh Slater, that I knew like me ould hat,
when I was but la&#8217;ad, and he was Cap&#8217;n of the
River Queen, one o&#8217; the floatin&#8217; palaces of the day
on the Ohio River.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill-Smith trembled a little, but answered,
coldly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you must have been misinformed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, hardly,&#8221; responded Senator Mulligan,
blithely, &#8220;since it was your own father as tould me,
not half an hour ago. I knew th&#8217; ould man well&mdash;an&#8217;
he was an honest ould cuss, but for tobacco-chewin&#8217;
an&#8217; bad whiskey ye&#8217;ll not find his match betune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
here and the lakes o&#8217; Killarney. He knew how
to turn th&#8217; honest pinny though, did ould man Slater.
No givin&#8217; of widders an&#8217; orphans the turn of
the scale, nor the turn of a hair neither&mdash;he was
out for the last rid cint. He was a good-lookin&#8217;
ould chap, when he was washed up and had on a
clean shirt&mdash;and now, I&#8217;ll say, I think you&#8217;re like
him&mdash;<i>raymarkably</i> like him&mdash;and it&#8217;s up to you to
prove that he wasn&#8217;t your grandfather, begorra!&#8221;</p>

<p>Had a bomb with a burning fuse dropped at Mrs.
Hill-Smith&#8217;s feet, she could not have been any more
astounded. She looked from Mince Pie Mulligan&#8217;s
laughing face to Eleanor Baldwin&#8217;s, and then
glanced helplessly around the circle. It was impossible
not to see that the British Ambassador,
Thorndyke, and the wretched Castlestuart-Stuart,
who was primarily responsible for the whole dreadful
business, were all enjoying themselves extremely.
Constance Maitland alone seemed to feel some
sympathy for the unfortunates. It was, however,
chiefly on account of Mrs. Baldwin, who began to
be painfully embarrassed, that Constance said,
smilingly, to Senator Mulligan:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your reminiscences are very interesting, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
what you say of Mrs. Baldwin&#8217;s father must give
her cause for honest pride. You have described a
phase of American life of which nobody need be
ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except them as has been through it,&#8221; promptly
responded Senator Mulligan. &#8220;There&#8217;s some things
human nature&#8221;&mdash;he called it &#8220;natur&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;will always
be ashamed of as long as it is human nature.
One of &#8217;em is that more people blush for a rise in
their family than for a fall. And it ain&#8217;t so foolish
as it seems; because, if you were born on top
of the pile, and all your people were, bedad, you
don&#8217;t do any of these outlandish things such as me
young friend,&#8221; indicating Castlestuart-Stuart,
&#8220;has been tellin&#8217; us about. By the way,&#8221; asked
Senator Mulligan, explosively, of the terrible Castlestuart-Stuart,
&#8220;who was it give the dinner anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>And what should that scion of aristocracy, the
Honourable Edward George Francis Castlestuart-Stuart,
do but answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Baldwin&#8217;s was the last I went to&mdash;but there
were plenty of others!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ambassadors are not supposed to laugh&mdash;but at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
this, the British Ambassador abandoned all hope of
keeping serious. Constance was laughing frankly,
Thorndyke was in quiet convulsions, Castlestuart-Stuart
and Senator Mulligan were exchanging
sympathetic grins&mdash;and then Eleanor Baldwin said,
with the air of an offended queen:</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa, give me your arm.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Mr. James Brentwood Baldwin, with a
heightened colour, did, but not before Senator
Mulligan genially remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the best of frinds must part, so here&#8217;s
good-bye and good-luck to ye, Jim Baldwin, and
I&#8217;ll say to you, Miss Baldwin, I hope ye&#8217;ll live and
die as honest as ould Danny Hogan, your grandfather,
and a better man never stepped in shoe-leather;&#8221;
and then, turning to Mrs. Hill-Smith,
Senator Mulligan continued, &#8220;I commind to you
the example of your grandfather, Cap&#8217;n Josh Slater,
that I had the honour of knowin&#8217; and who always
got what he wanted, and was an agreeable man
enough barrin&#8217; the bad tobacco and mean whiskey.
But in the polite society in which we find oursilves,
in these dazzlin&#8217; halls of light an&#8217; scenes of pothry
an&#8217; splendour, both Cap&#8217;n Josh Slater an&#8217; good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
ould Danny Hogan wud be about as much at home
as a ham sandwich at a Jew picnic!&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words, Senator Mince Pie Mulligan
bowed himself off, leaving a great trail of social
devastation behind him.</p>

</div>

<p>Congress adjourned on the 15th of June, just two
months after it was convened in extra session.
Thorndyke&#8217;s apprehensions had been confirmed.
Few legislative follies had been committed&mdash;the
House had gone with the people, leaving to the
Senate and the Administration the disagreeable task
of stemming the popular tide as far as possible,
when it rushed on too fast. No reputations had
been damaged in either House, and several had been
made&mdash;but none to equal Julian Crane&#8217;s. As for
Thorndyke, the newspapers seemed to have forgotten
his existence.</p>

<p>By the time adjournment was reached, Washington
was deserted. The class which is designated as
&#8220;everybody&#8221; was either going or gone. The outgoing
steamers carried half the town across the
ocean. Thorndyke had promised himself a treat&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
trip to Europe that year&mdash;the first since that
long-remembered one which had settled his fate in
some particulars for him. It was the first time in
years that he felt he could afford it, for he was a
free-handed man, generous to his invalid sister, not
averse to lending money when he had it, and fond of
giving presents. To do this on his Congressional
salary did not leave much surplus. This summer,
however, he concluded he could take a three months&#8217;
trip. Constance Maitland&#8217;s return had not changed
his determination, because he felt that he could not,
in decency, follow her wherever her summer wanderings
might take her; and if he could not be with
her, he would rather, just then, be in Europe.</p>

<p>But one word from Constance, on the afternoon
when he went to bid her farewell, changed all this
in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>He found that she had just returned from a near-by
place in Virginia, where her family had been established
many generations before the Louisiana
Purchase had sent them toward the Gulf of Mexico.
Constance was full of her Virginia trip, and told
Thorndyke that she meant to take, for the summer,
the old family place, Malvern Court, at the foot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
the Blue Ridge Mountains, where many generations
of dead and gone Maitlands had lived and flourished,
after their migration from their first American
home on the shores of the Chesapeake. She
showed him a photograph of the place. It was an
old brick manor-house, very tumble-down, but picturesque,
with noble old trees around it, and even in
the picture it conveyed a delicious look of repose.
It was the sort of a place where nothing startling
had ever happened except the Civil War, and nothing
ever could happen again. The present owner
of the place, an elderly maiden lady, &#8220;Cousin Phillis,&#8221;
was the last of her race. She had taken up the
notion that, she would like to spend the summer at
&#8220;the Springs,&#8221; as she had done &#8220;in papa&#8217;s time,
and grandpapa&#8217;s time;&#8221; and Constance, meaning
to confer a benefit on her, had offered to rent Malvern
for the summer at a price which would have
been dear for a Newport cottage. The old lady,
after a long struggle, had agreed. Constance did
not tell all of this, but Thorndyke shrewdly suspected
that the arrangement was designed to help
Cousin Phillis far more than she imagined.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Cousin Phillis thinks she is doing me the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
greatest favour in the world, and that she is giving
me the place for nothing,&#8221; Constance explained,
smiling, to Thorndyke.</p>

<p>Then she went on to tell of her battles with Cousin
Phillis regarding what was necessary for the house.
Cousin Phillis could not conceive that anything
should be wanting at Malvern Court, which stood
exactly as it was at the beginning of the war, minus
forty odd years of wear and tear; and Constance
had only got the old lady&#8217;s consent to fit up the
house somewhat, according to modern ideas, by
promising to remove every one of the new-fangled
fallals and gewgaws when she should give up the
place. By hard fighting she had got Cousin Phillis
to agree to have some painting and papering done,
and hoped when once Cousin Phillis was out of the
way, that the house could be made as comfortable
as it was picturesque.</p>

<p>It was two hours by train from Washington and
six miles from the nearest railway-station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it not be very lonely for you up there?&#8221;
asked Thorndyke, smiling at Constance&#8217;s description
of her efforts to benefit Cousin Phillis against
her will.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>&#8220;Ah, you do not know Virginia cousins,&#8221; answered
Constance. &#8220;Nobody yet was ever known
to want for company in Virginia. The two days I
was at Malvern it rained cousins. Each one had to
be treated with distinguished consideration, and
after I had worn myself out with civility to them&mdash;for
they were coming all day and half the night to
call on me&mdash;Cousin Phillis gently intimated to me
that if I wasn&#8217;t more attentive to my relations I
might find myself very unpopular with them; and
I find that in Virginia to be unpopular with one&#8217;s
relations is to be an outcast. They regard me with
great suspicion; my Louisiana ways and my Louisiana
accent only half please them; and they seem
to think me a very forgetful person because I do
not remember every birth and death in the family
which occurred during the seventy or eighty years
that the Maitlands have been established in Louisiana.
I hope,&#8221; she continued, smiling, &#8220;that you
will have the opportunity to meet some of my Virginia
cousins. I shall have a great many house-parties
during the summer, and you are among those
I shall invite. I hope you may accept.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I accept now,&#8221; replied Thorndyke, and in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
breath his trip to Europe melted away and was as
if it had never been. Then Thorndyke very artfully
found out the hour of her departure, which
was to be three days later.</p>

<p>When Constance, on a warm June morning, arrived
at the station, with her five negro servants and
her household and personal paraphernalia, to start
for her summer in Virginia, she found Thorndyke
waiting for her. In the station he had met Annette
Crane, who had just seen a constituent off on the
train. At the same moment they caught sight of
Constance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Thorndyke, &#8220;go with me and say
good-bye to Miss Maitland. She is a real friend
of yours, and I know she will be glad to see you before
she goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel that she is a real friend,&#8221; answered Annette.
&#8220;I never knew a woman in whom I felt
greater confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Constance is a very loyal and a very large-minded
woman,&#8221; replied Thorndyke, absently. He had
used her first name inadvertently, and only became
conscious of it when Annette began laughing softly.
Then he coloured violently, and explained that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
had lost his mind, or lost his manners, or something
of the sort, to account for his calling Miss Maitland
by her first name.</p>

<p>They came upon Constance very smartly dressed,
as always, and looking young and animated. She
was superintending the tickets and luggage of herself
and her five servants. There were innumerable
boxes and trunks to be seen to, besides a couple of
traps and a pair of horses, and Constance was doing
it vigorously, with Scipio Africanus, her
young butler, and Charles Sumner Pickup, her
coachman, acting as purely ornamental adjuncts,
giving her frequent and disinterested advice about
the horses, the trunks, and other impedimenta,
but in reality being waited on by their mistress.
Whenever negroes go on a journey, they at once become
children, and are treated as such by those who
understand them. In a group stood the cook, an
elderly, respectable negro woman, dressed in black,
with the stamp of &#8220;fo&#8217; de war&#8221; written all over her
honest black face, and a housemaid and a lady&#8217;s
maid, both chocolate coloured.</p>

<p>Whenever Thorndyke had observed Constance&#8217;s
servants before, they had been dressed with entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
correctness&mdash;but on this occasion they had evidently
been allowed complete latitude. The two maids
wore the shortest of short skirts, with violent-coloured
shirtwaists. They had on hats exactly alike&mdash;large
picture-hats of white, with wreaths of red
roses. The same riot of colour had broken out on
Scipio Africanus and Charles Sumner Pickup.
Scipio sported a scarf-pin composed of two United
States flags crossed, while Charles Sumner Pickup
carried a cane from the handle of which fluttered
red, white, and blue ribbons. The cook, who was
plainly an ante-bellum product, had donned, for
the journey, an immense crape veil, which dangled
to the ground, and implied that she was in the first
stages of widowhood. As a fact, she had &#8220;planted
her ole man,&#8221; in the Afro-American vernacular,
about thirty years before, but at intervals since, she
had adorned herself with the crape veil, as a dissipation
in dress akin to the maids&#8217; wreaths of red
roses, and the butler and coachman&#8217;s assumption of
the national colours.</p>

<p>Thorndyke, on reaching Constance&#8217;s side, proffered
his assistance, but his offer was promptly repulsed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;How on earth would you manage five negroes?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;You would lose your patience in five
minutes&mdash;you do not know what they know or what
they do not know. I think I have everything
straight now&mdash;I will keep the tickets myself&#8221;&mdash;and
then, escorted by Thorndyke, she saw her five
charges and the horses, the traps, and the trunks in
their proper cars, and, sending Thorndyke after
Annette Crane, herself took her place in the drawing-room
car for her two hours&#8217; trip.</p>

<p>When Annette stepped in the car to spend ten
minutes with her, Constance was sincerely glad.
She felt a strong and strange sympathy with Annette
Crane. Never were women more dissimilar in
type, in environment, in ideas, than those two women;
but both were gentlewomen of sense and right
feeling, and on that common ground they met and
became friends.</p>

<p>Constance expressed a wish that Mrs. Crane
might be in Washington the next winter, and Annette
quietly replied that she expected to be.</p>

<p>Thorndyke then began telling her of his amusement
at watching Constance, with five servants,
working like a Trojan for them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>&#8220;Of course, you, with your cool Northern temperament,
cannot understand the negro,&#8221; replied
Constance, good-humouredly. &#8220;You would expect
a negro to work when he could help it. What a delusion!
Suppose I had trusted Scipio or Charles to
buy those tickets and get those horses aboard, and
meanwhile a street-band had come along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose Scipio or Charles would have got the
tickets and attended to the horses just the same,&#8221;
answered Thorndyke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you? That shows your utter density regarding
Scipio and Charles. I daresay you
thought it very amusing that I should work for my
servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They work for me when I want them and make
them&mdash;that is, they work in a certain way&mdash;<i>their</i>
way. And I suppose you would have that United
States flag pin off Scipio&#8217;s bosom and that cane
with the red, white, and blue ribbons out of Charles&#8217;s
hand if you were travelling to Newport with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I should.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you could not stand the wreaths of red
roses on the hats of my two maids?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;I am quite sure I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Mr. Thorndyke, stop legislating for the
negroes, because you know nothing about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit,&#8221; said Thorndyke, &#8220;that the patience
and indulgence of Southerners toward negroes has
always amazed and charmed me. But I believe the
negro would be better off if he were made to assume
greater responsibilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to. Can the Ethiopian change his skin?&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then, Mr. James Brentwood Baldwin and
Eleanor sauntered into the state-room of the car.
They were to join a yachting party at Old Point
Comfort. They spoke distantly and coolly to both
Constance and Thorndyke&mdash;the memory of Senator
Mince Pie Mulligan&#8217;s candid praise of &#8220;ould
Danny Hogan at th&#8217; corner grocery&#8221; was still a
green and smarting wound in their breasts.</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin&#8217;s English valet and Eleanor&#8217;s
French maid were doing everything possible for the
comfort of their master and mistress and with perfect
intelligence. Thorndyke smilingly indicated
it, but Constance shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always hearing complaints about French
and English servants in this country, but we who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
are accustomed to negro servants never complain of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you never require anything of them;
however,&#8221; added Thorndyke, &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit there seems
to be a comfortable sort of arrangement between
you. It would drive any but Southern people mad,
but you don&#8217;t seem to mind it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Constance, turning to Annette, said she
would be so glad if she and Mr. Crane would pay
her a visit during the summer. Annette&#8217;s eyes
sparkled; it was a distinct triumph for her, because
she knew, and knew that Crane knew, that he
never would have been asked but for her. She
thanked Constance warmly, but said she was afraid
it was impossible&mdash;she never went away from Circleville
in summer; and Constance, seeing longing
in Thorndyke&#8217;s eye, repeated her invitation to him,
and made his middle-aged heart beat fast by doing
it; and then it was time to go, and the train pulled
out, and Constance was gone.</p>

<p>Thorndyke put Annette on her suburban car,
and walked back to his lodgings, through the hot,
bright streets&mdash;hot and bright in spite of the lush
greenness of the shade. But the day had turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
lead coloured to him; and although there were still
plenty of persons in town, and the capital was
seething, for it was yet some days before adjournment,
Thorndyke felt as if the whole town were
silent and deserted.</p>

<p>The presence of Constance Maitland made any
place full for Geoffrey Thorndyke, and her absence
made a desert to him. He contrasted in his
own mind his feelings of to-day and of a year ago.
Then, he had reached a kind of dull acquiescence
in fate, or thought he had. Despairing of forgetting
Constance, he had learned to endure quietly
the poignant pain of remembering her, and in default
of all else in life to interest him he had thrown
his whole soul and being into politics. Now, the
sound of Constance Maitland&#8217;s voice, the touch of
her hand, was always with him, and had turned an
otherwise dull and prosaic world into a region of
splendid tumult and delicious agitations, for he
would not have gone back to his past state for anything
on earth. Constance had a deep regard for
him&mdash;of that there could be no doubt. She commanded
his society whenever she could; she exerted
herself to please and flatter him; and he accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
it as a man drinks water in the desert, not analysing
it, but exulting in it. Even those frequent seasons
when he called himself a blankety-blank fool
were not devoid of enjoyment&mdash;at least, it was not
stagnation. He yearned after a million or so of
money, that he might lay at Constance&#8217;s feet, and
ask her to throw away the fortune that stood between
them, but he was too sound and sane a man
to imagine that he would ever be a rich man. Politics
had by no means lost its interest for him, but
rather had it gained&mdash;that at least was something
to give him value in Constance&#8217;s eyes. As for that
bare possibility of the senatorship two years hence,
in the event that Senator Standiford should retire,
Thorndyke regarded it as an iridescent dream. He
did not believe that Senator Standiford would retire.
He heard no more of Letty Standiford&#8217;s delicate
health, or the Senator&#8217;s, either. Letty was
rushing about Washington in an automobile, helloing
at young gentlemen on the street, and doing
many loud, unnecessary, and innocent things which
require much nervous energy and lung-power. The
Senator himself gave no indications of ill-health
and fatigue. In Washington he led a life as regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
and temperate as that of a boarding-school
miss, but when local elections were impending, or
a national convention was on hand, Thorndyke had
known the old gentleman to go for a fortnight at a
time almost without eating or sleeping, and then
come out looking as fresh as a daisy. So Thorndyke
was a little sceptical about his boss&#8217;s possible
retirement from the field, and took it that the Senator
had been trying some sort of an intellectual
bunco game upon him.</p>

<p>When the adjournment of Congress was reached,
Thorndyke took the first train to his northern home.
It was a comfortable old place, on the skirts of an
old colonial town left high and dry among more
progressive places; but shady, serene, and comfortable
in the extreme. Here, in the house where he and
his father and his grandfather and great-grandfather
were born, Thorndyke&#8217;s summers were spent
with his sister Elizabeth, a gentle, sweet-faced
creature, who had not walked for many years, but
whose mind and hands were busy doing such good as
lay in their reach.</p>

<p>Down in the town before a wooden one-story office
with a porch, hung a battered tin sign, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
had been repaired and repainted twenty times since
first, in Geoffrey Thorndyke&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s time,
it had borne the legend, &#8220;Geoffrey Thorndyke,
Counsellor at Law.&#8221; Thorndyke still kept the
dingy little office which had been his grandfather&#8217;s
and his father&#8217;s before him. He had given up the
best of his law practice at the time that he had
been thrown down and securely roped for Congress
by Senator Standiford and his trusty cowboys, the
State Committeemen, but had always clung to the
old law-office as a refuge in case Senator Standiford
should relegate him to private life. Although he
had been compelled to abandon the active and continuous
practice of his profession&mdash;for according to
the old axiom, &#8220;The law is a jealous mistress&#8221;&mdash;Thorndyke
remained a student of law. He was by
nature and training a very considerable lawyer, and
his legal acquirements had helped to win for him
the high and steady position he held in the House of
Representatives. He was not a leader of men, but
rather a thinker and adviser, and was proud of the
somewhat scornful appellation of &#8220;the scholar in
politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his quiet summer home, among his few shabby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
books&mdash;which, unlike Mr. James Brentwood Baldwin,
he read diligently, and never thought to mention
that he lived among them&mdash;Thorndyke spent
his placid summers. He read much, and observed
a great deal. He was close to the border of Crane&#8217;s
State, and their congressional districts were contiguous,
and naturally Thorndyke knew the political
happenings across the border.</p>

<p>In all his experience of men, Thorndyke had
never watched with the same interest the development
of a man in his public and private life as he
watched Julian Crane&#8217;s. He saw the good and the
evil struggling together in Crane, and had not yet
found out which was fundamental.</p>

<p>Crane, with Annette and the two children, had
returned to Circleville immediately after the adjournment
of Congress, and immediately, on reaching
home, he had been beset with a temptation,
against which he had made a short, hard fight, and
then was conquered, and gave up all the honesty of
his soul as regards politics. One week after his return
to Circleville, he had received overtures for
peace from Governor Sanders, and a meeting between
them had been arranged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>It took place in a neighbouring city, in the private
parlour of a hotel. The two men were entirely
alone. Sanders, a bull-dog of a man, came out
frankly and told Crane that, by the cutthroat policy
they were pursuing, they were simply playing
into Senator Bicknell&#8217;s hands, and depriving the
State of its just weight with the National Committee
in the year of a Presidential convention. His
proposition was a large one, but was put in a few
words. The Governor began by freely admitting
that Crane had got the best of him in the matter
of the senatorial appointment&mdash;the politicians were
agreed on that. But all men make blunders, and
Governor Sanders proposed to atone for the blunder
he had made about the senatorship by joining
forces with Crane instead of opposing him further.
It was plain that there was a strong revolt against
Senator Bicknell, and a split was inevitable among
the chiefs as soon as the Legislature met, which
would elect a senator. When this break came, new
alignments must be made, and Governor Sanders
believed and said that if he and Crane should join
forces they could oust Senator Bicknell and get
control of the machine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>At the mention of Senator Bicknell&#8217;s name, Crane
changed countenance, and mumbled something
about his political obligations to the Senator. Sanders
met this by saying that it was his opinion, if
Senator Bicknell were not ousted, there would be
grave danger that the party would lose the State at
the next election; and, in any event, there must be a
new arrangement of forces, and he was simply proposing
to take advantage of the inevitable. He
then went on to explain briefly his plan. The protocols
must provide that Governor Sanders should
throw all his strength toward getting Crane the
party nomination for the short senatorial term in
January, and second Crane&#8217;s efforts to succeed
himself. In return, Crane was to devote all his
energies toward securing the Governor&#8217;s election
two years hence to succeed Senator Bicknell. Meanwhile,
Senator Bicknell was nursing a very robust
and promising Vice-presidential boom, which must,
of course, be strangled in the cradle. Nothing
must be heard of it at the next Presidential convention
a year hence; but four years hence, when both
Crane and Sanders would be in the Senate, it would
be time enough to decide which one would strive for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
it. The geographical position of the State and the
uncertainty of the elections for many years past
would put them in a very good strategic position
either to capture the Vice-presidential nomination
or to dictate it to the convention; and that was a
prize which could be held in reserve.</p>

<p>The success of the whole, however, depended upon
keeping Senator Bicknell in the dark, for although
he had not displayed the qualities of a truly great
boss, like Senator Standiford, yet he was a man of
considerable force, well liked, a gentleman, and a
favourite in his party. If he suspected the plotting
of an insurrection against him, he might in two
years&#8217; time overthrow it completely; but he was an
unsuspicious man&mdash;a bad thing in a boss&mdash;and
could be easily deluded into believing that no effort
was necessary on his part to hold his own. For
that reason, the warfare between Sanders and Crane
should be ostensibly kept up. Especially must this
be the case in selecting delegates to the National
Convention. Senator Bicknell&#8217;s aspirations for the
Vice-presidential nomination must be frosted on the
apparent ground of dissensions among the leaders
in the State&mdash;but as soon as the election was over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
they could come together and have four years&#8217; amicable
struggle to prove whether Sanders or Crane
should be seriously put forward for the Vice-presidential
nomination five years hence.</p>

<p>Crane listened to this nefarious scheme with disgust&mdash;a
disgust in which a great longing was
strangely and violently mingled. Every word that
Sanders said was true; Crane knew that perfectly
well. The machine was going to pieces&mdash;there could
be no doubt of that&mdash;and Crane, with accurate
knowledge of conditions, saw that the Governor&#8217;s
plan, although far-reaching, was quite practicable.
The whole thing, however, hinged upon keeping
Senator Bicknell in the dark. If it had been a free,
fair fight, the Governor and himself might be
worsted. Senator Bicknell might be considered the
founder of Crane&#8217;s political fortunes, and had certainly
treated him with great kindness, and had
procured his advancement; but then, it was a question
whether the great law of necessity would not
compel Crane to go with Sanders. Senator Bicknell
would not, if he could, ruin Crane, but Governor
Sanders was fully capable of it, and would, if he
could. Indeed, Sanders conveyed as much.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said, carelessly, as he lighted a
cigar, &#8220;you would have to be very circumspect in
every way from now on. Voters, you know, are
easily offended. As a matter of business, purely, I
shall mention to you that there has been some talk
about your leaving your wife at home during your
time spent in Washington. I have heard that,
except for the short visit she paid you during the
extra session, she has not been there since the first
session at which you took your seat. Of course,
everybody knows that it is all straight between you,
but it was a mistake on your part, just the same.
It will give your enemies a handle against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane grew pale. How strange it was that in all
those years he had never been conscious of the supreme
folly of his behaviour! It had not once occurred
to him until that evening in Washington,
hardly more than a month ago!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Crane remained by choice in Circleville
on account of the children,&#8221; replied Crane, &#8220;and
because my salary as a congressman doesn&#8217;t admit
of my having my family there as I would wish&mdash;particularly
as I had some debts to pay, and my
house in Circleville has a mortgage on it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;Oh, I understand perfectly, Mr. Crane. All of
us who know you do. I was not speaking of the
views of your friends, but of your enemies, on the
subject. However, if money is the consideration, I
think I could guarantee your senatorial term in
good style; nothing extravagant, you know, but
enough to put your mind at ease. Your notes,
with my indorsement, would be accepted at any
bank in the State, and the matter could be kept
quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the old story&mdash;making chains out of his
necessities. And they were very great. Crane
spoke of paying his debts. He had scarcely made
any reduction in the principal, and had only succeeded
in paying the interest&mdash;which, with his living
expenses, of which his own were twice as much
as Annette&#8217;s and the children&#8217;s, and his small life-insurance,
had galloped away with his five thousand
a year. And if he should lose the nomination&mdash;there
was not much danger of that now, but everything
was possible with a machine and a man like
Governor Sanders.</p>

<p>Crane&#8217;s better nature, however, rebelled against
the deceit to be practised on Senator Bicknell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
That he declared he could never bring himself to&mdash;and
believed it at the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Governor Sanders, rising, &#8220;we
may conclude our conference. The entire success
of the campaign I have mapped out depends upon
Senator Bicknell not being taken into our confidence.
We are not proposing anything against the
party; we are simply proposing to do for ourselves
what Senator Bicknell has done for himself;
and if things go on as they have been going under
his direction, I think we stand an excellent chance
of losing the State at the Presidential election.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Crane&#8217;s ardent mind loomed a vision.
Six years in Washington as a Senator&mdash;and he was
not yet forty-three years old; living in good style,
and then, the chance, not a bad one by any means,
of the Vice-presidential nomination in a little over
four years. It was a glorious vista. Like the
Arabian glass-seller, his imagination far outstripped
itself. He saw himself, at forty-eight,
Vice-president, at fifty-two, another term, at fifty-six,
still in the Senate, with a great reputation&mdash;even
the Presidency did not seem beyond him. He
had the enormous advantage of youth over most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
of his rivals. A Vice-president stands one chance
in three and a half of succeeding to the Presidency&mdash;altogether,
it was a dazzling dream&mdash;so dazzling
that Crane began to feel the old regret and longing
that Fate had not given him a wife like Constance
Maitland; he was afraid even, in thought,
to wish that it might be Constance Maitland.
How that woman would shine in an official position!
And then, the other side&mdash;but there was no
other side. Without Sanders&#8217;s help, he would have
a desperate fight before the Legislature; and that
outlook which had seemed so rosy when he described
it to Constance Maitland in her drawing-room
a few months before, grew dismal and gruesome
when examined in parlour number 20 of the
Grand Hotel. If defeated for the senatorship,
and under the ban of Governor Sanders, his seat,
a year hence, would be certainly doubtful, and if
the machine ran over him it meant annihilation.
So, tempted of the devil, Crane yielded, and promised
everything the Governor required.</p>

<p>As the Governor had found him an uncertain
quantity before, there were due precautions taken
to keep him in the traces this time, by veiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
threats of what would befall him if he kicked them
over a second time. Crane understood perfectly
well. He also realised that there were two men
under his skin&mdash;one, honest and loving the truth,
and the other, craving money and power and consideration,
tormented with vanity, enslaved by
self-love, a fierce and hideous object to contemplate.
But he need not contemplate it; and with
this determination he took a friendly cocktail
with the Governor, and departed for Circleville.
That hint about his wife opened Crane&#8217;s eyes to
the necessity of the outward practice of virtue, and
he then determined to compass, as far as in him lay,
the whole comprehensive sin of hypocrisy. He
would be very attentive to his wife and devoted
to his children. He would go to church regularly.
He would adopt a Cincinnatus-like mode of life,
that out of his small means he might contribute to
charity and have it known by the special correspondents.
In short, he proposed to become that
object of man&#8217;s hate and God&#8217;s wrath, a hypocrite.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Eleven</i><br />


<small>IN THE SWEET-DO-NOTHING OF THE SUMMER-TIME</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Straightway, Crane began a hypocritical mode of
life, and deceived everybody in the world except
the two most necessary to deceive&mdash;himself and his
wife.</p>

<p>He did not deceive himself. There was enough
of honesty in him to make him loathe himself,
while doggedly carrying out the devil&#8217;s programme,
into which he had entered with Governor
Sanders. As he went to church on summer Sundays,
with Annette by his side and the two children
trotting soberly in front of them, Crane felt as
if a bolt from heaven ought to descend upon him
for his treachery to the man who had befriended
him. Sitting in the cool, dim church, his head
devoutly bowed as if in prayer, he doubted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
there was a personal God; for if so, how could He
tolerate such blasphemy us a man praying, to be
seen of men; giving, to be published in the newspapers,
and saying to his brother, &#8220;How is it with
thee, my brother?&#8221; and then stabbing him in the
back?</p>

<p>At one thing, the evil spirit within him shuddered
and turned away. This was when he had a
very friendly letter from Senator Bicknell, saying
he should be in the neighbourhood of Circleville
in the next fortnight, and if convenient he
would accept Crane&#8217;s often-urged invitation to stop
and spend a day at his house.</p>

<p>The idea of receiving under his roof the man he
had betrayed was too much for Crane. Enough
moral sense remained in him to make him shrink
from that. He wrote Senator Bicknell a very
friendly and even affectionate letter explaining
that important business would take him away from
home for that week, and expressing the deepest regret
that he could not have the long-promised visit.
And forthwith, on the promised day, Crane made
an excuse of business, and went speeding toward
the nearest city. He said no word to Annette about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
his letter from Senator Bicknell, but some suspicion
of the actual state of things had crept into her
mind. She knew that Crane was under obligations
to Senator Bicknell, and a close reading of the
newspapers had shown her that Crane and Governor
Sanders were supposed to be mortal enemies.
Yet, she knew that the Governor and Crane were in
the most friendly communication, while Crane had
ceased to mention Senator Bicknell&#8217;s name. And
some anxiety was weighing upon him&mdash;that she saw
plainly. She saw that Crane was prosperous, that
he was rising in importance every day, and yet
was miserable. He had grown thin and pale in
those few weeks since he had entered into his evil
compact. It could not be want of money, because
Annette had never known him to be so well supplied.
She begun to suspect some moral lapse on
his part, and the thought nearly broke her heart&mdash;for
Julian Crane was the love of her life; and
she loved him in his degradation as profoundly as
in the time when she had believed him to be the soul
of honour.</p>

<p>A singular complication came of Senator Bicknell&#8217;s
letter. He did not get Crane&#8217;s in reply, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
on the day he had proposed to be in Circleville he
found himself at the little station. There was no
one to meet him, but it was easy enough to find the
way to Crane&#8217;s house&mdash;he was the local great man
of Circleville.</p>

<p>When he reached the house, with its many verandas,
embowered in fine and vigorous elm-trees, the
front door was wide open, and looking through the
low, wide hall, he could see the garden beyond.
There, under a tall lilac hedge, sat Annette in a
rustic chair, sewing. On a rustic table before her
the children had their books, and took turns reading
aloud to her. As always, she was simply but
freshly and becomingly dressed, and as the green
light fell upon her fair hair and her pensive, pretty
face, she made a charming picture for any man to
contemplate. Senator Bicknell had an &aelig;sthetic
soul as well as an honest heart, and the pretty scene
appealed to him. He walked through the hall, into
the trim garden, and, hat in hand, introduced himself
to Annette.</p>

<p>She rose at once, smiling and blushing, and made
him hospitably welcome. She knew nothing of his
expected arrival, which convinced Senator Bicknell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
that there had been some misunderstanding concerning
his letter. But the Senator was so pleased
with his first impressions that he accepted Annette&#8217;s
invitation to remain and share their one-o&#8217;clock
dinner&mdash;an invitation given with palpitations, but
so promptly and gracefully accepted that Annette
was delighted at her own courage in proposing it.
The Senator, seated on a rustic settee, and admiring
the aspect of things in the house and garden,
as well as the mistress and her children, thought
himself in luck. He expressed great regret at not
seeing Crane, but frankly declared himself very
well satisfied with things as they were.</p>

<p>Emboldened by her success in entertaining the
Senator, Annette proposed that she should notify
the leading citizens, and invite them to call at five
o&#8217;clock to pay their respects to him. Senator Bicknell
good-humouredly assented&mdash;it would be of advantage
to Crane, he thought, mistakenly enough&mdash;and
it was worth while obliging a subordinate if
that subordinate had a wife as pleasing as Mrs.
Crane.</p>

<p>By the time this was settled it was one o&#8217;clock,
and the Senator found himself seated at Annette&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
dainty table, with the two children, and being
waited on by Annette&#8217;s one servant, a neat, hard-featured
creature, who knew how to cook.</p>

<p>The Senator was worth millions, had a French
chef, and a chronic dyspepsia, but he spoke truly
when he told Annette he had not enjoyed a dinner
so much in years as the one she gave him. It was
very simple, but good, and well served. The children
never opened their mouths except when
spoken to. Annette was surprised, as at Constance
Maitland&#8217;s dinner, to find herself altogether at
ease, and was conscious that she was making an
agreeable impression every moment of the time.
To be appreciated gives the most timid confidence;
and it was perfectly evident that this trained
man of the world appreciated this woman, as sweet
and natural as the wild roses that grew in the roadside
hedges. They found much to talk about, and
Thorndyke was mentioned, at which Annette overflowed
in praises of him, to which Senator Bicknell
agreed.</p>

<p>He was much amused by Annette&#8217;s impromptu
plan of having a reception for him that afternoon,
and accused her of aspiring to be a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
Madame Roland, but laughingly agreed with her
when Annette assured him that it would be worth
several votes to Crane in the coming senatorial
contest.</p>

<p>After dinner he was shown to a cool and spotless
chamber, where he had a very refreshing nap
and a bath. At five o&#8217;clock he was summoned below.
Annette awaited him in the modest drawing-room.
She wore a pretty muslin gown, and
looked as fresh as a dewdrop. With the assistance
of the neighbours, the lower floor was dressed with
flowers, and simple refreshments were served upon
tables in the large and well-kept garden.</p>

<p>Annette, taking her stand at the door of the
drawing-room with the Senator, received with dignity
and grace the people who came pouring in&mdash;the
Judge of the County Court, the professional
men in the town, the principal of the Circleville
High School&mdash;all accompanied by their ladies,
wearing their best silk gowns and very tight kid
gloves. Senator Bicknell was affability itself. He
was an amiable man, and Annette Crane&#8217;s virtues
and charms were such as appeal peculiarly to men,
so that most of them wished to oblige her. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
secretly amused at the courage and capability she
had shown in organising a political reception for
him on such short notice, and determined to help
her through with it. By way of showing his goodwill,
he spoke with enthusiasm of Crane to many
persons, and said that he should be pleased if
Crane might be his colleague after the first of
January.</p>

<p>At seven o&#8217;clock he was obliged to take his
train. Before he stepped into the carriage of the
Judge, who had asked the honour of driving him
to the station, Senator Bicknell expressed to Annette
the most sincere gratitude and pleasure at his
visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Mr. Crane,&#8221; he whispered to her, &#8220;that
with a wife who has such masterly capacity for
political management as you, my dear Mrs. Crane,
he may expect any sort of promotion. If our State
is honoured by being awarded the Vice-presidential
nomination, I am afraid no one else will be heard
of except Mr. Crane, if you take the affair in
charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are laughing at me,&#8221; cried Annette, laughing
herself, but colouring with pleasure at Senator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Bicknell&#8217;s kind manner and flattering words.
&#8220;Imagine me as a political manager!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear lady, the only political managers in
the world, among women, are those like yourself,
who don&#8217;t know that they are managing. Good-bye,
and a thousand thanks. I have not spent so
pleasant a day for a long time. Remember, when
you come to Washington, you are to dine with me
many times, but I can&#8217;t make you enjoy your dinner
as much as I enjoyed mine. Regards to
Crane&#8221;&mdash;then, stepping into the carriage, the Senator
said to the Judge in a voice meant to be heard
by those around:</p>

<p>&#8220;Charming woman&mdash;sweet, well-behaved children&mdash;comfortable
home&mdash;our friend Crane is in
luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane did not return until the next evening, and
was greeted by the sensational news of Senator
Bicknell&#8217;s visit. Annette was, of course,
full of her achievement in entertaining the Senator.
Instead of receiving her account with the
pleasure which might naturally have been expected,
Crane listened with sombre eyes and a face
which grew pale and paler as Annette proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
with the story of the success of her impromptu reception.
It was indeed a horribly awkward complication
for Crane, and vastly increased his difficulties.
His chagrin could not be concealed, and
Annette was quickly convinced, to her distress and
amazement, that Senator Bicknell&#8217;s visit was anything
but pleasant to Crane.</p>

<p>When this was borne in upon her, she stopped
speaking, and involuntarily fixed her clear, accusing
eyes on her husband. All at once her suspicions
of the changed relations between Crane and
Senator Bicknell, and Crane and Governor Sanders,
became a certainty. In a moment of inspiration&mdash;the
inspiration of an intelligent honesty&mdash;the
probable state of affairs flashed upon her. She
remained silent for a time; they were seated alone
at the tea-table, in the garden, and the August
sunset was at hand. Crane&#8217;s countenance grew
anxious as Annette watched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the Senator say he had got my letter?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He expressly said he had not heard from you,&#8221;
replied Annette. &#8220;Did you go away from home to
avoid the Senator?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>It was but a chance shot, but it hit the bull&#8217;s eye.
Crane did not answer the question, but got up and
walked to the other end of the garden. They were
sitting and talking in the very spot where Annette
had so successfully entertained the Senator the
afternoon before.</p>

<p>She could not, of course, know the details, but
she knew then that Crane was a traitor, and was
pretending a goodwill which he was far from feeling.
Annette suffered as only a high-minded
woman can suffer when the lower man in one she
loves reveals itself. But she said nothing. She
knew that Crane must work out his own salvation,
and that she could be of no help to him
there.</p>

<p>And Crane, having a guilty conscience, knew
that Annette suspected the game he was playing;
and this made him more unhappy but not less
guilty than before.</p>

<p>Annette had told Crane of Constance Maitland&#8217;s
invitation to them, which piqued as much as it
gratified him. He knew quite well that but for
Annette he would have had no invitation. Later
on came a note from Constance repeating the invitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
very cordially, but Annette felt obliged to
decline it with all the thanks in the world.</p>

<p>So the summer passed for those two.</p>

<p>For Thorndyke the summer was, first, one long
anticipation of that visit he was to pay Constance,
and then, one long retrospection of it. He had enjoyed
every moment of it, although the beginning
was inauspicious. When he changed trains at
Washington to go into Virginia, whom should he
find in the Pullman with him but Mince Pie Mulligan,
who greeted him effusively. Thorndyke carefully
concealed his destination from Mr. Mulligan,
but the junior Senator was by no means so secretive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you where I&#8217;m going,&#8221; he said, in the
friendly juxtaposition of the smoker. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to a place up in Virginia to see that stunning
woman I met in Washington, Miss Maitland.
Never saw her but once, but, by Jove, that was
enough to make me want to see her again. I&#8217;ve
found out where she is spending the summer, and
I&#8217;m going there just to do a little prospecting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Mulligan had abandoned the violent brogue
which he had used on a former occasion, and spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
pretty fair English, but his mouth was as wide and
his hair was as red as ever.</p>

<p>Thorndyke, consumed with inward rage, inquired
blandly of Mr. Mulligan:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask if you were invited by Miss Maitland
to visit her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, no,&#8221; responded Mr. Mulligan, cheerfully.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m just prospecting. I don&#8217;t know
whether I shall like her or not after I know her better;
but I expect to like her. The way she sat
down on those two young women snobs added a
year to my life, and I&#8217;m thinking I gave &#8217;em a good
whack or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Thorndyke, longing to throw
Mulligan out of the car-window and under the locomotive
wheels, &#8220;you have engaged accommodations
in Miss Maitland&#8217;s neighbourhood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never a bit of it. I just found out that Miss
Maitland&#8217;s station was Roseboro&#8217; station on this
road, and I presume there must be some sort of a
hotel within reach, or I can stop at the next
town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no towns in that part of the county,
and Miss Maitland has informed me that there isn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
a hotel or boarding-house within ten miles,&#8221; replied
Thorndyke, stalking angrily back into the Pullman.</p>

<p>The train stopped at Roseboro&#8217; on being flagged,
and Thorndyke had one of the most delicious moments
of his life when he stepped into a smart trap
driven by Constance herself, and left Senator Mulligan,
the man of millions and of pies, stranded
at the station, which consisted of the passenger
shed and the station-master&#8217;s house, which had four
rooms, in which the station-master with his wife
and eleven children lived in much dirt and comfort.</p>

<p>Constance, sitting in the trap, looking remarkably
handsome in her summer costume and large
black hat, felt a thrill of sympathy for the unfortunate
Mulligan, standing in the little shed of a
station with his luggage piled around him. Not
so Thorndyke, who derived acute pleasure from
Mulligan&#8217;s miserable situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Constance to the forlorn Senator,
&#8220;that you will come over to see me some afternoon
while you are at Roseboro&#8217;. Malvern is only six
miles away.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; cried Mulligan, at once rising
into a mood of enthusiastic optimism, &#8220;I&#8217;ll call early
and often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fellow is a good-natured ruffian, but I
hope I&#8217;ll be out when he calls,&#8221; was Thorndyke&#8217;s
remark to Constance as they left the sandy road of
Roseboro&#8217; station and entered the cool and shaded
highway which led to Malvern.</p>

<p>As Constance and Thorndyke drove along the
sweet-scented country lanes, crossing streams by
rickety bridges and bumping up and down hills,
Thorndyke felt himself near Paradise. Constance
was so kind to him, so unaffectedly glad to see him.
Her country life had freshened up her complexion,
and she looked positively girlish, and her high
spirits were infectious. She described the house-party&mdash;Mrs.
Willoughby, half a dozen Virginia
cousins of different ages and sexes, a French friend
and her husband travelling in America, and Cathcart,
the navy man&mdash;at whose name Thorndyke
felt a sensible diminution of his happiness. Constance
was charmed with Malvern Court, and declared
it had been the happiest summer of her life&mdash;almost.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>&#8220;And when I think of those weary, dreary foreign
watering-places of which I grew so tired, and
of those tiresome Swiss hotels, I think I am in
Heaven to be once more in my own country among
my own kith and kin, and hearing no language but
good, honest English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I intended to go to Europe this summer,&#8221; said
Thorndyke, meekly. &#8220;I had planned it for two
or three years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you not go?&#8221; asked Constance, heedlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you asked me to visit you,&#8221; replied
Thorndyke, something within him forcing the
truth out of him against his will, and then he
added, hastily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, I&#8217;m a perfect brute. I wouldn&#8217;t
blame you in the least if you sent me back north
by the next train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up, Frolic, you idiot!&#8221; cried Constance to
her smart cob, and flicking him with the whip.
Her face coloured, her eyes shone&mdash;it was plain
she was not displeased. But a horrible suspicion
occurred to Thorndyke&mdash;possibly she was, after
all, a thorough-going flirt! Many of those Southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
women are, and can&#8217;t imagine why a man
should object to having a football made of his
dearest affections as long as it amuses the lady in
the case.</p>

<p>This gruesome and uncanny thought, together
with Cathcart&#8217;s presence at Malvern, was a huge
fly in Thorndyke&#8217;s ointment, but misery is as much
a concomitant of love as joy is, and Thorndyke
had his share of miseries.</p>

<p>The great live oaks were casting long shadows
on the large, smooth lawn when Constance drove up
to the doors of Malvern Court. It was a spacious
brick house with wings, and at the back a four-roomed
structure common to Virginia houses, and
known as &#8220;the office,&#8221; where the bachelors were
lodged. The house-guests were having tea under
the trees, where the shadows were long, when Thorndyke
and Constance joined them. Scipio Africanus
served the tea, which was iced, and was like
water in the desert to travellers. It was handed
with much ceremony by Scipio, who had doffed his
smart livery, and appeared in a snow-white linen
jacket. He was assisted by one of the coloured
maids, who now wore the smartest of smart caps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
and the neatest of neat print gowns instead of
the short skirt, pink shirtwaist, and picture-hat
which had electrified Thorndyke at the Washington
station a few weeks before. Constance Maitland
knew precisely when to relax and when to
tighten discipline among her staff of negro servants.</p>

<p>Like all people in a country house, the guests
were glad to see some one from the outside world.
It was a pleasant and amiable party, and Thorndyke
enjoyed himself in spite of Cathcart&#8217;s presence;
but Cathcart, being a remarkably pleasant
and personable man, everybody except Thorndyke
relished his company.</p>

<p>While they were lingering over tea, a ramshackly
buggy of the prehistoric age of buggies,
with an unkempt horse, was seen driving up the
winding, shady road which led to the lawn. In
the buggy sat no less a person than Senator Mince
Pie Mulligan. He had seen himself ignominiously
left in the lurch by Thorndyke, but with the same
spirit of enterprise which had made him the greatest
pie-manufacturer on earth he had investigated
his resources, and promptly pursued his object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
with the best means at hand&mdash;a sure mark of superiority.</p>

<p>When he alighted from his ancient buggy, Constance
advanced to meet him, and greeted him with
a cordiality which inspired Mr. Mulligan with admiration
and hope. He did not know that Southerners
in their own habitat meet every guest, however
undesirable, with the same overflowing cordiality,
which is reckoned as merely good manners.
Senator Mulligan, however, thought this custom
of generations a special tribute to himself, and
gloated over that cool, supercilious Thorndyke,
who had smiled in a superior manner at the Senator&#8217;s
predicament at Roseboro&#8217; station. So he replied
genially to Constance&#8217;s greeting:</p>

<p>&#8220;As you were good enough to ask me to call, and
as I don&#8217;t know how long I&#8217;ll be in these parts, I
said to myself, &#8216;Faith, I&#8217;ll pay Miss Maitland a
visit this very afternoon.&#8217; And here I am with this
ould cruelty cart, when I&#8217;ve got a stable full of
horses at home, and a Panhard red devil that cost
me six thousand dollars to buy and a thousand a
year to keep&mdash;but, like the butterfly, I get there
just the same.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>Constance, being a clever woman, looked into
Michael Mulligan&#8217;s soul and saw that it was honest,
according to his lights, and that his bragging
was not bragging at all, but an innocent way of
mentioning what the pie business had brought
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad to see you, Senator,&#8221; she replied,
smiling, and then gravely introduced this member
of the august Senate of the United States to the
group sitting about the tea-table.</p>

<p>Nobody but Thorndyke and Cathcart took in
the situation. The Virginia cousins, to whom political
preferment means that the object of it belongs
to one of the first families in his own home,
supposed that Mr. Mulligan, although certainly
very odd-looking, had a long line of distinguished
ancestors, and it was with much cordiality that an
ex-Confederate Colonel, grave and suave, with a
snow-white moustache and imperial, shook Mike
Mulligan&#8217;s hand, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am pleased, sir, to make your acquaintance,
and to bid you welcome upon the soil of old Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Frenchman, a retired army officer, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
wife, a thorough-bred French gentlewoman, were
equally polite, but they arrived at a much more
correct estimate of Senator Mulligan&#8217;s social status
than the ex-Confederate Colonel. As for the Honourable
Mike, he started in to enjoy himself in a
whole-souled manner, which would commend him to
all sincere persons. He drank three glasses of iced
tea running, complimented the late President Davis
and General Lee, declared that he meant to buy
up a good part of the State of Virginia, and
worked himself up into a whirlwind of enthusiasm
over everything he saw. This completely captivated
all the ex-Confederates present, amazed the
French strangers, and amused Thorndyke and
Cathcart beyond words. On leaving, Senator Mulligan
told Constance nothing but the truth when
he said that he had never enjoyed an afternoon
more, or had found himself among more &#8220;conjaynial
company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then began for Thorndyke a week of rapture,
mixed with agonising jealousy; for let no man
suppose that his passions have no more power to
trouble him after his hair grows scanty and his
moustache grows grey. In all those years of separation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
from Constance, the edge of Thorndyke&#8217;s
pain had been dulled, but the ache was still there;
and from the April night he had first seen her,
until then, he felt himself being steadily and securely
mastered by that great love of his life&mdash;as
steadily and securely as if he could have offered
her his honest and devoted heart. And to be thrown
with her daily&mdash;to spend the bright summer mornings
in the cool, old drawing-room with Constance,
listening to the pleasant, languid talk of people in
a country house, the shady afternoons in driving
over the rich, green, placid country, sometimes with
Constance by his side&mdash;the deep, blue nights, sitting
on the great stone porch, watching the silver moon
rise over the distant pine-crowned mountain-peaks,
and looking at Constance, in a thin white gown,
seeming as young by night as in those sweet Italian
nights long past&mdash;it would have been bliss but for
two things. One was that she was as kind to Cathcart
as to himself, and the other was that she was
so very kind to him. For since she could not possibly
think of marrying him, she could only be
amusing herself at his expense.</p>

<p>Thorndyke was nearly forty-five years old, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
was a member of Congress, and reckoned a peculiarly
cool-headed and long-headed man, but
he was thereby exempt from the agonies of
love.</p>

<p>As for Senator Mulligan, Thorndyke did not
need to recall the frank confession made on the train
to know that Mince Pie had speedily made up his
mind that Constance was worth the winning, and
to go about it with promptness and energy. On
the very last afternoon, Thorndyke, disgusted with
the goodwill which Constance had shown Cathcart,
retired to a rustic summer-house on the lawn, to
writhe in secret with jealousy, and incidentally to
read the New York newspapers. Presently he saw
Constance and Senator Mulligan walking across
the sward toward the house. Constance&#8217;s face was
flushed, and she was walking rapidly. Senator
Mulligan was talking earnestly to her, and his
brogue was more evident than usual, under the
stress of emotion. Immediately in front of the
summer-house Constance stopped and faced the
Senator.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must beg of you,&#8221; she said, in a clear voice,
with a faint ring of indignation in it, &#8220;to say no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
more on this subject to me now, or at any other
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve said about all I had to say,&#8221; replied
Senator Mulligan, warmly. &#8220;I asked you to marry
me, I did, and I tould you, I did, if you had to lose
what money you had because I&#8217;m an American,
thank God, that I&#8217;d make it up to you a dozen times
over. I said that, I did, and I didn&#8217;t desaive you
about the senatorship.&#8221; The brogue by this time
was rampant. &#8220;The thing was going a-beggin&#8217;,
and the Governor, he sends for me, and he says to
me, &#8216;Mike,&#8217; says he, &#8216;you&#8217;ll be nothin&#8217; but a stop-gap,
and don&#8217;t get any other notion into your red
head but that&mdash;and ye&#8217;ll step down and out the
first of January,&#8217; says he; &#8216;and don&#8217;t monkey with
the buzz saw,&#8217; says he. And I says, says I, &#8216;I
won&#8217;t, Governor, and I&#8217;ll have my fling at Washington,
and I&#8217;ll take down my Panhard red devil,
and go a-scorchin&#8217; over the Washington streets,
and have the time of my life,&#8217; and bedad, I have.
And I had no more thought of falling in love and
getting married than I have of trying to get up
a diligation to present my name to the next Prisidential
convention. But then I met you, Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
Maitland, and I came up here after you, and you&#8217;ve
bowled me over, senatorship and all, and I&#8217;ve tould
the truth, and not a lie in the bunch, and I&#8217;ve
offered to give up your money, and I don&#8217;t see that
I&#8217;ve done anything for you to look at me like Lady
Macbeth, and I beg your pardon if I&#8217;ve offinded
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>During this speech Constance Maitland&#8217;s heart
softened toward Mince Pie Mike. He had only
claimed a man&#8217;s inalienable right, and he had
behaved as honourably as in him lay. So she
said, with a softening of the voice as well as the
heart:</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure that all you say is true and I am
sorry if I have wounded you&mdash;but what you ask is
not to be thought of for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked the Senator, resignedly, &#8220;it&#8217;s
a disappointment, it&#8217;s a great disappointment, but
there are other things in life, Miss Maitland.
There&#8217;s the pleasure of helping widows and orphans,
and I swear to you I have done that as well
as I could iver since I was a clerk in good ould
Danny Hogan&#8217;s corner store, and there&#8217;s the pleasure
of managing the primaries and handing over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
the biggest batch of votes for the money of any
man in the State&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mulligan!&#8221; cried Constance, in horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s no denying of it in some States&mdash;and
there&#8217;s automobiling and plenty of other clean,
dacent pleasures to make up for love. But I tell
you, Miss Maitland, there never can be the time,
if I&#8217;m still single, that you can&#8217;t be Mrs. Michael
Patrick Mulligan, and your money may go to the
bow-wows for all I care, and I honour and admire
you above all the women I iver knew, I do that.
Good-bye. Don&#8217;t snub the life out of me in Washington
if I meet you next winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not, I promise you&mdash;good-bye,&#8221; said
Constance, and walking briskly into the summer-house,
while Senator Mulligan turned away, she
almost walked into Geoffrey Thorndyke&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help hearing,&#8221; said Thorndyke, with
a burning face. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get out&mdash;it would
have been beastly to the poor devil&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And then both of them suddenly burst into a
gale of laughter, nor could they, all that day and
evening, meet each other&#8217;s eyes without laughing
mysteriously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>Thorndyke&#8217;s visit lasted a week. It was a week
of heaven and hell to him. When he went away,
Constance Maitland realised that, to accomplish
her heart&#8217;s desire, she would have to do the proposing
herself, as Queen Victoria did on a similar
occasion.</p>

<small>WHAT IS IT TO BE HONEST IN POLITICS AND TRUE
IN LOVE?</small></h2>
</div>

<p>On the first Monday in December&mdash;a gloriously
bright winter day&mdash;the flags were run up over the
Senate and House wings of the Capitol building.
Congress had met once more.</p>

<p>There were the usual thronging multitudes in the
corridors, the usual pleasant buzz of meeting and
greeting in cloak and committee rooms, and the
cheerfulness and exhilaration of the last session
was flamboyant in the present one.</p>

<p>Among the last members of the House to arrive
was Julian Crane. He had come late because he
wished to put off as long as possible the meeting
with Senator Bicknell. Of course, they must meet
early and often, but that did not make Crane take
any less pains to postpone, if even for a day, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
sight of the man he had betrayed. But almost the
first acquaintance he ran across was the Senator
in a group of brother senators who had strolled
over to the House side.</p>

<p>Senator Bicknell greeted Crane with unusual
cordiality. In the first place, he really wished to
attach Crane to the Bicknell chariot, but he had
such agreeable recollections of his August day in
Circleville, of Annette and her spotless table, her
roast chicken and boiled corn, her sweet, fresh
spare bedroom, where he had enjoyed one of the
best naps of his life, and her impromptu reception
in the afternoon, that he felt an increased kindliness
for Crane. He showed this by button-holing
Crane in the midst of the group of senators, and
telling the story of his day in Circleville. He paid
Annette many sincere compliments, and declared
that if Crane should enter the senatorial contest a
year and a half hence, and should defeat him, it
would simply be on account of the charming Mrs.
Crane. It was not fair to pit a man with such a
lovely wife against a hopeless and incurable bachelor
like himself.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances Crane would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
been highly gratified, but now it tortured him.
He heard once more ringing in his ears Governor
Sanders&#8217;s words, &#8220;It is absolutely necessary that
Senator Bicknell be not taken into our confidence.&#8221;
To cap the climax, Senator Bicknell said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure and give my warmest regards to Mrs.
Crane, and tell her I shall take the first opportunity
to call on her&mdash;she is here, I suppose? She
mentioned last summer that she was coming on
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Crane, &#8220;we are established for the
season&#8221;&mdash;and he gave the name of a comfortable,
but not expensive or fashionable, apartment house
where they had quarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;And say to her that, although I can&#8217;t give her
a dinner half so good as what she gave me, I
shall expect her and you to arrange to dine with
me at my house at a very early day. Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane escaped and went to his seat in the House.
While he was contemplating the baseness of his
own conduct, Thorndyke came over and spoke to
him.</p>

<p>Thorndyke&#8217;s first impression of Crane was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
he looked haggard and worn, and Crane&#8217;s impression
of Thorndyke was that he had grown about
ten years younger. His greeting to Thorndyke
was very cordial, but he was conscious of a strange
thing&mdash;that ever since his bargain with Sanders,
the meeting with former friends, men of sterling
probity, gave him a vague uneasiness. It seemed
to him as if, in duping Senator Bicknell, he was
duping every honest man he knew. Thorndyke,
too, asked after Mrs. Crane, and it began to dawn
upon Crane&#8217;s mind that Annette had the power, in
a remarkable degree, of pleasing men of the world.
Still, he thought her not quite good enough for
himself, particularly if the brilliant future he
planned should materialise&mdash;as it must and should.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the day were perfunctory,
and it was but little after three o&#8217;clock when Thorndyke
left the House. The afternoon was briskly
cold, and the sun glittered from a heaven as blue
as June. Just as Thorndyke came out on the plaza
he encountered Crane, who would have avoided him,
but it was scarcely possible.</p>

<p>The two men walked down the hill, and toward
Thorndyke&#8217;s old quarters. They talked amicably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
and even intimately, but Thorndyke got a curious
impression of reserve from Crane&mdash;and reserve was
the last thing in the world to develop in Julian
Crane. As they walked along the streets in the
dazzling sun of December in Washington, they
were speaking of the great economic questions
with which the Congress would have to deal.
Thorndyke, as an accomplished lawyer, saw certain
difficulties in the way of regulating these matters
which Crane did not at first perceive.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; said Thorndyke, &#8220;it comes down to
whether either political party will deal honestly
with these questions. If they do, a solution will be
found, and the whole matter can, in the course of a
few years, be properly adjusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you call perfect honesty in politics?&#8221;
asked Crane, after a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather a large proposition,&#8221; replied
Thorndyke, laughing. &#8220;I should say, if called
upon to give an immediate definition, that perfect
honesty in politics means keeping one&#8217;s hands clean
in money matters, and being an outspoken friend
or enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane&#8217;s heart sank at this. He did not know why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
he should have asked such a question, and he was
hard hit by Thorndyke&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be a good, wide margin allowed for
offensive partisanship,&#8221; Thorndyke continued.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble with the professors of political
economy in colleges&mdash;they leave human nature out
of the equation. There&#8217;s my boss, Senator Standiford.
He is as honest as the day as far as money
goes, and honest in using his enormous power for
the good of the party, and he was born with the
notion that his party and the country are interchangeable
terms. He uses dishonest men sometimes,
but not dishonest methods. It is both
shameful and ridiculous that a great State like ours
should hand over such vast power to one man as it
has to Senator Standiford, but that&#8217;s not his fault.
It is rather to his credit that he has not misused
his power. The trouble is, that the people will get
accustomed to the system of one-man government,
and when Senator Standiford goes hence, the party
will choose another dictator, probably neither as
honest or as able as he.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Senator Standiford is a rich man. Suppose he
were poor? What percentage would you allow a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
poor man in political life in his efforts to be honest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t figure it out that way,&#8221; answered Thorndyke,
&#8220;although I ought to know public life from
the viewpoint of the poor but honest Congressman.
I am not worth ten thousand dollars in the world
outside of my Congressional salary. But as the
Kentucky colonel said on the stump, &#8216;I am as honest
as the times will allow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; persisted Crane, for whom
this discussion of honesty in public life had a powerful
fascination, &#8220;that the same man in certain
political circumstances would remain honest, while
in different circumstances he might succumb to
temptation? Take the case of a poor man in politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit that the most desperate venture on
earth is for a man to attempt to live by politics.
Some men have done it, like Patrick Henry, for example.
But those men are quite beyond comparison
with every-day men. However, Marcus Aurelius
says, &#8216;A man should <i>be</i> upright, he should not
be made to be upright.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>This saying of Marcus Aurelius troubled Crane.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
He did not fully believe it. He thought that Marcus
Aurelius, like the professors of political economy
in colleges and universities, left out of account
the great factor of human nature, which makes a
bad man to do good acts, and a good man to do bad
acts, and makes a man good at one time, bad at another,
and both good and bad together. Presently
he roused himself and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a great thing for any public man
if he could lead such a life that every word he said
or wrote could be printed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, have you been writing letters lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows, no! I have always had sense
enough for that&mdash;to write as few letters as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Crane felt a thrill of satisfaction&mdash;not
one line did Governor Sanders have of his.</p>

<p>The two men then began to talk about the political
situation generally, and Thorndyke noticed in
Crane an exultant spirit, a disposition to brag
which had been absent in him at the time of his first
rise into prominence, when it might have been
expected to develop. The truth was that Crane
found the only solace for his moral lapses lay in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
contemplating the splendid prizes which Sanders
had dangled before his eyes. He had come to believe
that some of these splendid prizes must be
his; it was incredible that he should not receive the
price for which he had sold his honour. And as
the case always is, whether a man is or is not wholly
bad, Crane promised himself at some future time,
when he had garnered all the fruits of his wrong-doing,
to lead a life of perfect rectitude.</p>

<p>Then they came to the street corner where their
paths diverged, and Thorndyke said at parting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please give my warmest regards to Mrs. Crane,
and tell her I mean to presume upon her past kindness
to me and call to see her in the evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen Miss Maitland?&#8221; asked Crane.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Thorndyke, who had just proclaimed
himself a man of truth. He had not, indeed,
seen Constance to speak to her, but the night
before, within two hours of his arrival, when he
had gone out to smoke his after-dinner cigar, he
had sneaked up to her house, and had watched her
as she passed to and fro before the lighted windows
of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Crane went upon his way gloomily, turning over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
in his mind his conversation with Thorndyke, and
all the difficulties of his situation, which were accentuated
by his being in Washington. The strong
fancy which Senator Bicknell had taken to Annette
made everything harder. It seemed as if all
those things which might be reckoned an unmixed
good for an honest man were a burden and a perplexity
to him, Julian Crane.</p>

<p>Thinking these uncomfortable thoughts, he
found himself at the entrance to the big apartment
house, and went to his own quarters.</p>

<p>They were small and cramped, but the locality
was good and the outlook pleasant. Annette
and the two children met him with smiles. The
children had grown acquainted with him and had
become fairly fond of him. As for Annette, she
had never, in all her married life, so striven to help
her husband as in the last few months, when she
had seen that he was troubled and suspected that
he was engaged in wrong-doing. All her pity, all
her loyalty as a wife, had risen within her. She
had gradually abandoned the attitude of reserve
which she had maintained toward him ever since
that first unfortunate experience in Washington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
so long ago. She reproached herself, as the good
always do, for not having been better. Had she
given him more of her confidence and sought his
more, she might now be in a position to help him,
or at least to sympathise with his trouble, whatever
it might be. But her conscience should never
upbraid her again for want of sympathy and tenderness
to him. He might tell her of his perplexities,
or he might keep them to himself, she would
be all tenderness and softness to him. And then the
hope was born and lived in her heart, which every
neglected wife has, that calamities of the soul as
well as the heart might bring her husband once
more to her side. For Annette had never ceased to
love her husband&mdash;and loving spells forgiveness
with a woman.</p>

<p>Crane dutifully delivered Senator Bicknell&#8217;s and
Thorndyke&#8217;s messages, and Annette&#8217;s eyes sparkled
with pleasure. She felt an increase of courage.
She thought Crane must have seen that she had
been a help, not a hinderance to him, socially and
personally, when she had been given a chance, and
she meant to show him that she could hold her own
in Washington as well as in Circleville.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>A week or two passed in all the gay confusion
of the beginning of the season in Washington.
Thorndyke had watched his chance to call on Constance
Maitland. Carefully avoiding her usual
day at home, he had called on a peculiarly raw and
disagreeable afternoon, very late, when he felt sure
that she must have returned from her daily drive.
He found her in her drawing-room, which was
dusky, although it was not yet six o&#8217;clock, with a
bright fire leaping high and making the charming
room bright with its ruddy glow.</p>

<p>Constance, wrapped in rich dark furs, her cheeks
tingling with the fresh cold air without, her eyes
sparkling, was standing before the blazing fire.
She was unaffectedly glad to see Thorndyke, and
he felt that sense of quiet well-being which always
came upon him when he was with her in her own
house. They had much to talk about. Constance
took off her furs and the long, rich cloak which
enveloped her, and sat down on the deep, inviting
sofa, and motioned Thorndyke to her side.</p>

<p>Among the persons they spoke of were Julian
Crane and Annette. Thorndyke volunteered the
suggestion that Crane was passing through some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
sort of a crisis&mdash;he was so changed, so silent where
he was formerly talkative, so full of vague exultation
and of equally vague depression. Thorndyke
had seen Annette and the children. Annette had
asked to be remembered to Miss Maitland, and
Constance replied that she should call at once to
see Mrs. Crane. She was not particularly interested
in Julian Crane&#8217;s crises, except that she said,
woman fashion, that he ought to be more attentive
to his wife.</p>

<p>Thorndyke then mentioned that Senator Mulligan
was in town, at which they both laughed.
But soon the conversation got down to the you and
I&mdash;the books each had read, the thoughts each had
pondered, the places each had been. Constance
had remained continuously at Malvern Court from
June until late in November. She had had a succession
of house-parties during the summer, but in
the golden autumn she had been quite alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the sweetest, the most peaceful life you
can imagine,&#8221; she said, thoughtfully. &#8220;All the
world was shut out, except Virginia cousins, but I
even escaped most of them. All day I was out in the
woods and lanes, riding or driving or walking, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
in the evening, with a wood fire, a book, a piano,
and a lamp&mdash;it was company enough, yet it was
solitude itself. It was like Omar&#8217;s shady tree
and loaf of bread and jug of wine and book of
verse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And thou,&#8221; added Thorndyke, under his
breath. He was watching her with a silent rapture
which possessed him on meeting her after an absence.
She surely had the softest and sweetest
voice in the world, and those charming tricks of
pronunciation&mdash;she called solitude &#8220;solee-tude&#8221; and
piano &#8220;pe-arno,&#8221; and was quite unconscious of it,
and bitterly denied any difference between her
speech and Thorndyke&#8217;s. Constance was conscious
of the adoring look in Thorndyke&#8217;s eyes; she had
heard the one suggestive word; perhaps it was that
which caused a happy smile to flicker for a moment
on her lips, revealing the faint, elusive dimple in
her cheek, but she continued as if she had neither
heard, nor seen, nor understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard about the solitude there is in
crowds, but I never could find it so. I am so dreadfully
sociable&mdash;Southern and Creole French, you
know&mdash;that I always find troops of friends and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
acquaintances in a crowd. But in that solitary old
country house in the autumn&mdash;that, if you please,
was to be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to have a passion for solitude,&#8221; said
Thorndyke, rather crossly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, only a taste for it at times. I never
contemplated with pleasure a solitary life, and I
have a horror of a lonely old age.&#8221;</p>

<p>What did she mean? Was she proposing to him?
Thorndyke was a good deal staggered by this
speech from the lady of his secret love.</p>

<p>The time sped fast with them, and both of them
started when a neighbouring clock struck seven.
Constance rose at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go and dress for dinner&mdash;and you&mdash;you
will remain?&#8221;</p>

<p>Such an idea had never entered Thorndyke&#8217;s
brain before, but in half a quarter of a second he
had accepted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Constance, airily, picking up
her muff, and putting her bare hands in it, &#8220;it&#8217;s
very improper for you and me to dine together
without others, but we have reached that comfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
age when we can commit all sorts of improprieties
in perfect safety. It is a fine thing to grow
old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That thought almost reconciles me to the loss
of my hair,&#8221; replied Thorndyke. &#8220;You will have
to excuse my afternoon clothes, of course, since
you have asked me to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. And out of consideration for your
feelings, I shall make only a demi-toilette.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently they were seated at a small round
table, and Scipio was serving a dainty little dinner.
How young they felt! There was no d&eacute;butante
or fledgling youth present to remind them that
Time had meddled with their hair and complexions,
no elderly persons to claim them as pertaining to
middle age. Thorndyke had rarely been more exhilarated
in his life. There might be a morrow;
nothing was changed by these stray hours of happiness,
but still they were hours of happiness. As
for Constance, she was radiant with pleasure, and
was at no pains to conceal it. Thorndyke, it is
true, always found misery and disappointment
waiting for him at his lodgings whenever he returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
from Constance&#8217;s house; but they could not
frighten off those occasional sweet hours which
bloomed like snowdrops in a barren and frosted
field.</p>

<p>One of the first visits that Constance paid was
to Annette Crane. As Thorndyke had seen anxiety
written all over Crane&#8217;s personality, so Constance
saw that Annette was not wholly at ease.
But she was unaffectedly glad to see Constance,
and soon returned the visit. Crane did not accompany
her. He was beginning to feel a species of
resentment toward Constance. Why, although he
had told her of the comforting and sustaining
power she had for him, had she chosen to treat
him exactly as she treated all other men, except the
few whom she chose to favour outrageously? Why,
when she showed him any consideration, was Annette
the obvious cause? Self-love was beginning
to do for Crane what conscience had failed to do&mdash;emancipate
him from his admiration for a woman
other than his wife.</p>

<p>A day or two after reaching Washington, Crane
had left a card for Senator Bicknell. When Senator
Bicknell returned the visit, Crane, luckily, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
not at home, and the Senator paid his call on Annette
and enjoyed it very much. He had said to
her at leaving:</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, Mrs. Crane, you promised to dine
with me many times in Washington, so that I may
repeat, as far as possible, that pleasant day at Circleville.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am prepared to fulfil my promise,&#8221; replied
Annette, smiling, &#8220;but I hope you will give me a
better dinner than I gave you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More kickshaws, perhaps, but nothing better.
My dear lady, you must remember the difference
between a <i>gourmand</i> and a <i>gourmet</i>. One, the
<i>gourmand</i>, is a crude product, and would prefer
<i>my</i> cook. The <i>gourmet</i>, who is a critic by profession,
would certainly prefer yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was arranged that Annette and Crane should
dine with the Senator to meet a large party the
next week. If Crane should be found to have an
engagement, Annette was to notify the Senator.</p>

<p>But he had made none. When he returned from
the House that, evening, at six o&#8217;clock, Annette
told him of the Senator&#8217;s visit and invitation, and,
as ever since the summer, as soon as Senator Bicknell&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
name was mentioned, a look of guilt and
shame came upon Crane&#8217;s expressive and mobile
face. There was, however, no ground for declining,
and, besides, had he not agreed to keep on the
best possible terms with Senator Bicknell until&mdash;until
the time came to betray him? And as he
would be obliged to meet Senator Bicknell socially
many times in the two years he would be plotting
against him, Crane had no object in avoiding
him now; but in meeting him, Crane had the grace
to suffer pain.</p>

<p>On the night of the dinner, Annette, arrayed
in her white cr&ecirc;pe, was among the prettiest women
present. It was a very large dinner, extremely
magnificent, and made up of important persons,
but Annette Crane was by no means unobserved or
unadmired. Crane was forced to see that. She was
placed near to Senator Bicknell, and he paid her a
degree of kind attention which would have been
flattering to any woman.</p>

<p>When the dinner was over, and the gentlemen
were about joining the ladies in the superb Louis
Seize drawing-room, Senator Bicknell whispered
to Crane as they passed from the Louis Quatorze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
dining-room, &#8220;Remain half an hour after the others
leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane started&mdash;had the Senator heard anything?
He reassured himself by remembering that
the Senator would not attack him, an invited guest,
and in the presence of his wife. But the thought
of a private interview with Senator Bicknell on any
subject was disquieting to Crane.</p>

<p>When the last carriage had driven off, and only
Crane and Annette remained, Senator Bicknell
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come into my den; and, as I propose to take
Mrs. Crane into my confidence, on account of the
extraordinary political capacity she manifested at
my visit to Circleville, I shall ask her to let us smoke
while I unfold a scheme to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The den was a small, luxurious room, in the Louis
Quinze style, and fit to harbour Madame Pompadour
herself. It was shaded by opalescent lamps,
Turkish rugs covered the parquet floor, and pictures
and bric-&agrave;-brac worthy of a palace were to
be found there. Some people thought that the Senator&#8217;s
den was one of the causes of the weakening
of his political power. Many rural legislators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
reckoned his &#8220;fixin&#8217;s&#8221; as wicked, and were only reconciled
by hearing of the prices paid by the
Senator for Percheron horses and Jersey heifers.
The Senator did not care a rap for either
Percherons or Jerseys, and scarcely knew a Percheron
horse from a Jersey cow, but it was a concession
to the rural statesmen, and he wisely reckoned
these bucolic luxuries in his political expenses.
Seated before a fire of aromatic wood, Senator
Bicknell, offering a choice cigar to Crane, and taking
one himself, began to unfold his scheme. Annette,
her white gown brought into high relief by
a ruby lamp swinging overhead, sat silent and listened.
She did not, apparently, watch her husband&#8217;s
face, but she knew every expression which
passed over it, and could have interpreted it, as well
as every tone of his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;To come to the point,&#8221; said the Senator, blandly,
&#8220;I am one of a number of gentlemen interested
in a deal of about two million acres of land in Texas.
We have had an offer to sell our holdings and
we have determined to accept. Part of the purchase-money
is to be paid in cash, and there is also
a transfer of property contemplated for about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
million of dollars. Our attorneys are in Chicago,
but meanwhile we want a man to go down to Texas
once in a while and see how things are coming on,
and attend to some matters of detail which I will
state later on. The whole matter will hardly be
settled under a year. We propose to pay a fee of
ten thousand dollars and a small commission. I
should say there was something like twenty thousand
dollars in it for the right man. Several, of
course, have been suggested, but you know, Mr.
Crane, I am like John Adams was about New England
men&mdash;there never was an office existing or
created during John Adams&#8217;s time that he hadn&#8217;t
a constituent ready for it. So, when the necessity
for a man for this work became evident, I suggested
I had a constituent, likewise a colleague, in the
lower House, who could manage the job if he would,
and mentioned your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twenty thousand dollars! It seemed to Crane
an enormous sum. Then he heard Senator Bicknell&#8217;s
voice continuing:</p>

<p>&#8220;It would oblige you to take a trip to Texas
during the Christmas recess, and you would have to
spend two or three months down there next summer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
but I am persuaded we shall reach an early adjournment,
so it would not necessarily interfere
with you in any way. Besides, it might be useful
to you in other ways, and it would be decidedly useful
to me. It would show the people in the State
that you and I are working well together in harness,
and God knows I need some assurances of the
sort to be given! That scoundrel, Governor Sanders,
has been knifing me right and left all over the
State, and I look for trouble both at the convention
next summer and when I am up for re-election a
year and a half from now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane remained silent a minute or two and grew
pale. Senator Bicknell thought he was a little
overcome at what was really a very magnificent offer
to a man in his situation in life.</p>

<p>Annette, who had taken in, with perfect intelligence,
all Senator Bicknell was saying, kept her
eyes away from her husband. If he were in league
with Governor Sanders&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Crane was not only overcome, he was overwhelmed.
The thought came crashing through his
brain, &#8220;This is the man I am secretly trying to destroy.&#8221;
Every word the Senator uttered seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
to have the force of a thousand voices. &#8220;That
scoundrel, Sanders.&#8221; Yes, Sanders was a scoundrel,
but he had never pretended to be a friend of Senator
Bicknell&#8217;s, nor was he indebted to the Senator
for anything. Their warfare had been open and
above-board, while his&mdash;oh, God! Crane could have
cried aloud in his torture when he recalled the
league with hell into which he had entered. His
head was reeling, he heard the Senator&#8217;s voice afar
off; the ruby light falling upon Annette, in her
shining white gown, seemed to be a hundred miles
away. Yet, with a calm voice, and with only a
slight tremor of his hands, Crane answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you from the bottom of my heart. You
have made me a very splendid proposition; twenty
thousand dollars to a rural Congressman is a great
deal of money, and as for the confidence you show
in me, I feel it more than I can express.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was conscious that he was displaying wonderful
nerve; when he began to speak he scarcely
knew whether he could get through with a single
sentence, but he had spoken with tolerable ease and
composure. Of course, he must appear as if he
would accept; he could not on the spur of the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
devise any plausible refusal; he must have
time to think; but it was utterly impossible that
he should consider the matter for a moment.
He was not yet bad enough for that. If only he had
remained honest! For nothing brings home a
man&#8217;s evil-doing to him more than when he sees
the result in a concrete form. His wrong-doing
comes out of the regions of mind and morals,
and becomes a tangible and visible thing, like an
incarnate devil. He realises his sin when he receives
the wages of sin.</p>

<p>Annette listened to every note in Crane&#8217;s voice,
and heard there falseness. He was not happy, not
grateful for the offer. But she, at least, thanked
Senator Bicknell from the bottom of her heart for
his kind wish to benefit them. When he finished
speaking she leaned toward him and laid her hand
on his, while her eyes glowed with a lambent light.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you&mdash;I thank you, not only for my husband
and myself, but for our little children. It
means an education for them&mdash;many things their
father and I have longed that we might give them
when they are older, but feared we could not.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>Senator Bicknell raised her hand to his lips and
kissed it gallantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear lady,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am glad to oblige
your husband, and I believe he will render a full
equivalent for whatever he makes out of this transaction.
And I have frankly told him that I think
our co-operation in business will be a good thing
for me politically. But the day I spent at your
house, the kind hospitality to your husband&#8217;s
friend, the sweetness of your home, the excellent
behaviour of your children, quickened very much
the interest I felt in Mr. Crane, and it was a factor
in my effort to serve him. Come now, Crane,&#8221; said
the Senator, tapping him on the shoulder, &#8220;all I
ask is that when I am up for re-election, if you
choose to contest the election with me, you will
please leave Mrs. Crane at home. If ever she enters
into the campaign, I am lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will enter the campaign, but it will be for
you,&#8221; replied Annette.</p>

<p>Crane then pulled himself together, and again
expressed his appreciation of Senator Bicknell&#8217;s
kindness, and asked when they could meet to go into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
details of the affair&mdash;a meeting at which Crane was
determined to decline the benefits offered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, some day next week. I&#8217;ll let you know
when I hear from Chicago,&#8221; replied the Senator,
and after a little more desultory talk the Cranes
rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I took the liberty of sending your carriage
away, and my chauffeur will take you home,&#8221; said
the Senator, mindful of attentions to a pretty and
pleasing woman.</p>

<p>In a little while Annette and Crane were seated
in the Senator&#8217;s automobile, and rushing through
the frosty December night toward home.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Thirteen</i><br />


<small>WAR AND PEACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Crane remained perfectly silent. He did not speak
a word from the time they left Senator Bicknell&#8217;s
house until they reached home. Annette said nothing
to him. The conviction was deepening in her
mind that her husband had secretly behaved ill to
Senator Bicknell. Crane had revealed unconsciously
that night many things which Senator Bicknell
had not understood, but which Annette understood
only too well. The slight agitation and discomposure
which Crane had shown was not the mere
shock of a grateful surprise. Annette detected
that every word Crane had uttered to Senator Bicknell
was false; that his apparent acceptance of the
offer was false. The money was much&mdash;much to
her; the loss of it, after it had been held up to her
gaze, would be much; but the loss of Crane&#8217;s integrity&mdash;ah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
could that but be preserved, she would
go out and dig for him and for her children!
She would slave, she would starve, she would do anything
that any woman ever did, that she might feel
her children were the children of an honest man.
She remembered there was such a thing as heredity,
and she trembled at the thought that, if Crane were
really a scoundrel, as Senator Bicknell had said
Governor Sanders was, her little black-eyed Roger
might be a scoundrel, too, before he died. These
thoughts, surging through her mind, kept her
silent.</p>

<p>Crane felt her silence to be ominous as she felt
his to be. As he sat dumb, by her side, his agitation
increased instead of diminishing. On what
possible ground could he excuse to Annette, as well
as Senator Bicknell, his declination of such an
offer? But he could not accept it&mdash;he was not yet
a thorough villain. Had he been a free agent, he
would have preferred the splendid vista of power
and preferment opened to him by his deal with
Sanders to more money even than what was offered
him; but he was not a free agent. He had promised
Sanders, and if his nerve failed him he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
be ruined by Sanders politically, and perhaps personally
as well. True, Sanders did not have a line
of his writing&mdash;such agreements as theirs are not
put on paper&mdash;nor had he, so far, borrowed a dollar
from Sanders, although he expected to do so
the first of the year when his notes fell due.</p>

<p>While he was thinking these thoughts, he found
himself before the door of the great caravanserai
where they lived, and presently he was sitting
in their little drawing-room alone at last, and face
to face with the strange circumstances which had
befallen him. He sat in a great arm-chair drawn
up to the embers of the fire. On the table at his
elbow a light was burning. He heard Annette go
into the children&#8217;s room and remain five minutes&mdash;she
always said a little prayer above their cribs
every night before she slept&mdash;then she went into
her own room.</p>

<p>She turned on the light by her dressing-table,
and sat down to take off her few simple ornaments
and the ribbon-bow in her hair. The face that met
her gaze in the mirror looked so strange that it
frightened her. Yes, like Crane himself, she had
been surprised at her own self-control. But she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
knew as well as she knew she was alive that Crane,
in some way, had betrayed Senator Bicknell, the
man who, after honestly admitting that Crane
could serve him, was yet animated by a sincere wish
to benefit Crane; who had given Crane his first political
start in life, and had treated him with unvarying
kindness ever since.</p>

<p>The more she thought over what had happened
that evening, the more acute became her fear and
her pain. She stopped in her employment, and, leaning
upon her arms, sat motionless for a long time.
Suddenly, the distant chiming of a clock told her
it was midnight. She roused herself, and then, following
an influence stronger than herself, went into
the next room, where Crane had been going
through his agony alone. As she approached him,
he raised a pale and conscience-stricken face to
hers, but it was quite calm. He had fought the
battle out, and there was no longer a conflict within
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, as if continuing out aloud a consecutive
train of thought, &#8220;I should be very grateful
to you&mdash;I <i>am</i> grateful to you. No doubt, Senator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
Bicknell was influenced very much in what he
did by the admiration and respect he has for you.
But it only makes it the harder for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There should be no question of gratitude between
you and me,&#8221; replied Annette, coming closer
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is much&mdash;much. I have not realised
until within the last few months how much I really
owe you&mdash;but why do I say months? I might say
the last few hours&mdash;the last few minutes&mdash;and I
have also realised how much more I might have
owed you, for I am beginning to think that few
women are as well adapted as you are for the wife
of a man like me. Not all women would have borne
with poverty and seclusion as you have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>A deep blush suffused Annette&#8217;s face. The poverty
and seclusion had been in a way forced upon
her by him, but, being a woman of invincible discretion,
she did not put her resentment into sarcastic
words, or words at all. She stood by him silently,
and, seeing that Crane was striving to speak,
awaited his words gently, laying her free hand on
his shoulder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>At last it came&mdash;a full confession&mdash;made in
broken words and phrases, but of which Annette
understood every word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could have stood anything but his kindness,&#8221;
said Crane, with a pale face of woe. &#8220;That unnerved
me completely. I made up my mind I could
not accept the money, and then it occurred to me
that you had a right to be consulted, and immediately
I felt a conviction as loud as a clap of thunder,
as penetrating as lightning, that you would
never in the world let me accept that money. Ah,
Annette, what a thing it is to have an upright wife!
To feel that however weak and wavering a man
may be, that half of his soul, of his heart, of his
possessions, the half owner of his children, stands
like a rock for truth and honesty! Thorndyke
was saying something to me the other day about
a man being upright instead of being made to be
upright. I tell you, there are many men who can be
made good or bad&mdash;and I am one of them&mdash;by
their wives. Many a poor wretch to-day is a rascal
who might have led an honest and respected life
if but he had had a high-minded wife like you.
It is you who have saved me, and what a miserable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
return have I made you for all you have done for
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you have just said repays me for all, because,
you know, I have always loved you&mdash;better
than you cared to know, or than I cared to show
during the last few years,&#8221; Annette answered, in a
calm voice.</p>

<p>Crane rose and opened his arms to her. It was
the sweetest moment of their lives. Shameful and
dishonourable as Crane&#8217;s course had been, here was
one person who loved him, believed in him, and, oh,
wonder of love and faith, still honoured and trusted
him!</p>

<p>After their first rapture of love and forgiveness,
action occurred to Annette&#8217;s practical mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; she said, as if a course of conduct
had at once been revealed to her, &#8220;you must at
once withdraw from your agreement with Governor
Sanders. Of course, he will do everything he can
to defeat you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we shall have to go back to Circleville and
begin life over again. But I am sure you can do
well at your profession, and, remember, there is as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
much chance for an ambitious man in law as in
politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you can&#8217;t imagine how the life gets
hold of one. It seems like death to me to leave
Congress&mdash;and when I was steadily rising, too&mdash;and
to be driven out ignominiously by a creature
like Sanders! But I must do it; you would not let
me do otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I would not let you do otherwise. Then
you must go to Senator Bicknell and tell him
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I should? Do you think I
<i>could</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. He must know it some time. He must
know why you decline this scheme he has arranged
to benefit you. You must go to him early to-morrow
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane looked at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is half-past twelve&mdash;he always sits up until
two or three o&#8217;clock in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will think my repentance a mere emotion&mdash;he
will believe that my character was shown in my
agreement with Sanders.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>&#8220;No matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, no matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annette gave him his coat and hat and gloves.
He turned to kiss her, and instinctively he removed
his hat with a respect that approached reverence.
This pretty pebble which he had so lightly regarded
had proved to be a jewel of great price.</p>

<p>Two hours later Crane re-entered the house and
went softly to his own rooms. As he noiselessly
opened the door of the drawing-room he saw that
Annette had fallen asleep in the great chair in
which she had found him. She had thrown a fur
cape around her bare neck and arms, but it had
slipped partly away, leaving her white throat exposed.
There were traces of tears upon her cheeks,
but her face, though mournful, was placid&mdash;and
how young she looked! It seemed impossible that
she should be the mother of two children as old as
Roger and Elizabeth.</p>

<p>As Crane approached her quietly, she stirred,
opened her eyes, and sat up, in full possession of
her wits. Crane drew a chair up and took both her
hands in his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t felt so at ease in my mind since the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
day last summer that I first met Governor Sanders.
I have repented and confessed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good,&#8221; said Annette, in a clear voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found Senator Bicknell just where I had left
him, in his den; I told him the whole story&mdash;how I
had yielded, because I was poor and ambitious,
where a better man would have resisted. I told him
there was no fear of my falling away this time;
that you would not let me; and if I had kept you
with me, and had taken you more into my confidence,
I believe I should never have entered into this
damnable bargain with Sanders. The Senator was
staggered at first. I don&#8217;t believe the slightest idea
of my being disloyal to him had entered his head,
but as soon as he recovered from the first shock he
behaved nobly. I told him that I had not written
a line to Sanders, he had not loaned me a penny,
although I had expected to call upon him the first
of January. Then Senator Bicknell said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;So, you have not committed any overt act
against me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; I said, &#8216;but chiefly because the time was
not ripe.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You have, so far, only agreed to betray me?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>&#8220;I said yes, but that was crime enough. He reflected
a while, and then he held out his hand and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let bygones be bygones. Sanders will make
you pay for this, and that will be punishment
enough. But I am ready and willing to believe
that, no matter how much you might have agreed
to knife me, when the time came you wouldn&#8217;t have
done it. At the first moment we meet in private,
at the first hint of kindness on my part, your resolution
to do me wrong melts away. That must
count.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And something else,&#8217; I said. &#8216;Of course, I
can&#8217;t accept the benefit you thought to confer on
me. That would invalidate all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What does your wife say to this?&#8217; he said.
&#8216;You remember the offer was made in her presence.
Or does she know that you wish to refuse it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My wife would not let me take it if I wished
to,&#8217; I replied. &#8216;She is a much more high-minded
person than I am or ever can be.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;She must indeed be high-minded,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;and you are right in saying that to accept it
would invalidate everything. I am of the opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
that your wife has seen clearly in this instance.
But&#8217;&mdash;here he took a turn or two up and down the
floor&mdash;&#8216;I don&#8217;t think it would invalidate my promoting
your candidacy before the Legislature in January.
It seems to me now to be the best thing for
both of us. The fight with Sanders has got to
come, and the sooner the better, so that the field
can be cleared for my own fight a year and a half
from now. Yes, it is decidedly best. You may recall
I indicated last spring that I would support
your senatorial aspirations in certain contingencies.
These contingencies have come to pass. I
doubt if we can save the State to the party without
joining forces now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I told him that I owed money, and could
hardly support the position of a Senator here with
the salary, less what I was obliged to pay in interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nonsense,&#8217; he said; &#8216;turn your salary over to
your wife; she is a woman of uncommonly sound
sense, a good manager&mdash;that I saw in her house.
Of course you can&#8217;t go into society on less than
your salary, but you can live comfortably and respectably.
And let me tell you, this town is full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
of big houses which caused the Senators who built
them to lose their elections. It doesn&#8217;t hurt a man
with his constituents in the least to live simply.
Some of the gentlemen from the rural districts
have complained bitterly of this little place&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, after more talk, everything was settled.
I wasn&#8217;t to write to Sanders, of course, but
to go and see him. Sanders wouldn&#8217;t dare to proclaim
what we agreed to do, but he will fight me
with every weapon at his command. I shouldn&#8217;t
much care how things went&mdash;that is, so I feel now&mdash;except
for Senator Bicknell, but every blow at
Sanders helps the Senator, and I shall fight for
him as long as breath warms my body. When we
parted I was much overcome, and I think Senator
Bicknell was, too. Coming home, it occurred to me
how well you had managed on the pittance I allowed
you at Circleville.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not much, but it could hardly be called a
pittance,&#8221; replied Annette, smiling through her
tears, for the stress of emotion under which she had
suffered had found its natural vent at last, and she
was weeping a little. But they were happy tears.
Crane had reached the turn in life when it was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
be determined whether God or the devil should be
his master, and he had turned his back on Satan.
He took his wife in his arms and kissed her tenderly
and reverently. No one knew better then than he
the moral beauty, the power to charm, to sustain,
to lead forward, of the woman he had not thought
worthy to stand by him in Washington.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning early, Crane started West.
He had his fateful interview with Sanders and returned
to Washington within a week. Sanders&#8217;s
words had been few, but full of meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t take any stock in
this awakening of conscience business. You think
Bicknell can serve you better than I can. Very
well. We will see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly, and apparently without volition,
Crane&#8217;s right arm shot out and his open palm
struck Sanders&#8217;s check. The Governor, as quick
as thought, hit back. He was a brute, but not a
coward. Then both men came to their senses, and,
hating each other worse than ever, each was
ashamed of his violence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>The Governor, taking out his handkerchief,
coolly wiped the blood from his nose, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to engage in a fist fight with you.
We can settle all our quarrels when the Legislature
meets. You will need all your courage then.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Crane returned to Washington, he went
straight to Senator Bicknell and told him all.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied the Senator, as Governor
Sanders had said. &#8220;This is my fight now,&#8221; and
straightway the Senator took the midnight train
for the State capital to pull off his coat and do
yeoman&#8217;s work for Crane, and incidentally for himself.</p>

<p>The month of December was bright and beautiful
all the way through, and the sunshine lasted
into January. Thorndyke thought he had not
been so nearly happy for a long time. He saw
Constance often, and she was beautifully kind to
him. He scarcely went into society at all, and had
the hardihood to decline an invitation to one of the
Secretary of State&#8217;s small dinners on the comprehensive
excuse of &#8220;a previous engagement,&#8221; which
Mrs. Hill-Smith, who had invited him, did not believe
in the least; and when she had plaintively mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
the names of various English, French, Russian,
Austrian, and German diplomats who were to
be present, Thorndyke had replied in a manner
which mightily discomposed Mrs. Hill-Smith:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then, you won&#8217;t miss a stray American or
two!&#8221;</p>

<p>If Mrs. Hill-Smith had had her way, she would
have missed every American invited.</p>

<p>Thorndyke saw much of the Cranes and of the
children, who showered their favour upon him. He
could not but be struck by the new note in Crane&mdash;something
subdued, yet full of hope&mdash;and he had
quite lost that look of harassment and dejection
which, on first meeting him, had struck Thorndyke.
Crane was normally a lover of fighting, and, although
Senator Bicknell, for strategic reasons,
chose to keep him in Washington while the preliminaries
to the senatorial fight were raging, yet he
delivered some good shots at long range, and it began
to look as if he might be elected for the short
term in spite of Governor Sanders. The National
Committee was not indifferent to this fight, and
Senator Bicknell went into it with all his old-time
vigour. He worked, ate and drank, waked and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
slept, with members of the Legislature for three
weeks before the election came off. It was a stupendous
battle, and neither side got any odds in
the betting.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the Christmas recess,
Thorndyke went north to pay his sister, Elizabeth,
a visit. Her first words to him were:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Geoffrey, how young you look!&#8221;</p>

<p>And everybody who met him told him he looked
young, or looked well, or looked prosperous, and
one horny-handed old constituent hazarded the
opinion that Mr. Thorndyke was &#8220;thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; gittin&#8217;
spliced.&#8221; It was all because Constance Maitland
had been kind to him.</p>

<p>On his way back to Washington he found himself
in the same car with James Brentwood Baldwin,
Junior, who was coming home to be nursed and
taken to Palm Beach after an attack of the chicken-pox.
This fifteen-year-old youth was in charge of
a valet who attended to him assiduously, and even
went into the dining-car with him to see that he exercised
due prudence with regard to his diet. This,
however, was superfluous, as the scion of the house
of Baldwin was the very epitome of prudence, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
turned away from entr&eacute;es, sweets, and ices with a
degree of virtue which, to Thorndyke, dining at
the same table with him, seemed superhuman in a
boy of any age. Thorndyke watched the Baldwin
boy curiously; it was one of the most deadly and
fascinating phases of the whole newly-rich question
to him, how the children of the newly rich were
brought up. He observed in the Baldwin boy a total
lack of the normal faults and virtues of the normal
boy. Young Baldwin eyed Thorndyke at first with
suspicion, but Thorndyke, wishing to examine and
classify the specimen of a boy before him, intimated
that he was acquainted with the James
Brentwood Baldwins in Washington. Then James,
Junior, abandoned something of his hauteur. He
acknowledged being the pupil of a school at which
Thorndyke happened to know the fees were made
purposely so high as to exclude any but the sons of
the very rich. They had an Anglican nomenclature,
a resident chaplain, and the spiritual direction
of the masters as well as the pupils was attended to
by the Bishop of the diocese&mdash;the brother of the
Secretary of State. All this James, Junior, communicated
while toying with his rice-pudding, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
turning an eye of stern disapproval at the tutti-frutti
ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you expect to be when you grow
up, my lad?&#8221; asked Thorndyke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be a philanthropist,&#8221; replied James,
Junior, with dignity. &#8220;I shall try to use my
wealth as a means of benefiting others. I am president
of our association for giving Christmas gifts
to poor boys, and I like it very much. We, who
have superior advantages, should try and extend a
helping hand to others less fortunately placed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Less fortunately placed! Thorndyke looked at
the boy with the deepest commiseration, and pitied
the poor children of the rich.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can learn a great deal from a poor boy,&#8221;
said he, presently, watching the boy&#8217;s solemn, handsome
face. He might have been a hearty, wholesome
youngster, this grandson of Danny Hogan&#8217;s,
had he but been given a chance. &#8220;The poor boy is
the normal boy; a boy should be generally dirty
and noisy; he should occasionally get a lecture
from his mother and a licking from his father, and
a black eye from some other boy. He must be a
fighter. No less a man than Paul Jones has said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
that he never saw a liar who would fight, or a fighter
who would lie; and he must not only tell the truth
himself, but be ready to lick any other boy who tells
him a lie, for boys are, to themselves, a law-making
body, and must enforce their own laws.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not the way of the boys at our school,&#8221;
icily replied James Brentwood Baldwin, Junior,
rising with dignity and receiving his hat from the
hand of his valet.</p>

<p>The day of Thorndyke&#8217;s arrival in Washington
he was walking along the street in the bright,
sunny, early afternoon of winter. He stopped to
buy an afternoon newspaper, that he might see how
the balloting for Senator was going in Crane&#8217;s
State, when a shout aroused him, and Letty Standiford,
in a gorgeous crimson automobile, with Senator
Mince Pie Mulligan by her side, dashed up to
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thorndyke,&#8221; shrieked Letty, playfully
pretending she meant to run Thorndyke down. &#8220;I
have a piece of news for you. Look out, this is my
new red devil&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean Senator Mulligan, but
my auto.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly shall look out when you are around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
in that death-dealing machine,&#8221; replied Thorndyke,
dodging barely in time to save his legs.
&#8220;What is your news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just this. Dad gave me his word this morning
that he would not be a candidate for re-election
next year. I went after the doctors myself, and
made them tell me the truth about Dad&mdash;he&#8217;s the
only father I&#8217;ve got, you know. And they all told
me the same thing&mdash;that if he could slack up work,
and retire at the end of his term, he was good for
twenty years more, but that if he kept at the grind,
his life wasn&#8217;t worth a pin&#8217;s purchase. Dad wasn&#8217;t
scared by that, but when I told him that I should
die of fright and distress if he went away and left
me, the poor old thing weakened, and said he&#8217;d decline
a re-election, and&mdash;oh, good gracious! He
told me not to breathe it to a soul! He actually
shook his finger at me when he said it. Oh, heavens!
If you or Senator Mulligan give me
away&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad will shake his finger at you again,&#8221; replied
Thorndyke, laughing. Nevertheless, his pulses
had started off at a great rate.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that&mdash;it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m afraid of him&mdash;but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
it would break his dear old heart to think
I had disobeyed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty Standiford, as she said this, was an object
for angels to love, in spite of her wild air, her
mannish hat and coat, her flying and dishevelled
locks.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is safe with me,&#8221; said Thorndyke, gravely,
and Senator Mulligan spoke up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Divil a word will I say about it. I&#8217;m too much
afraid of th&#8217; ould chap&mdash;and of you, too, Miss
Letty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to hear it, Sinitor,&#8221; replied madcap Letty,
viciously mimicking the Senator&#8217;s unfortunate accent,
&#8220;and, oh, Mr. Thorndyke, have you heard
that Miss Maitland is engaged to Mr. Cathcart,
the navy man, who is always hanging around her?
It was announced this morning. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty flashed off, with a bicycle policeman after
her full tilt.</p>

<p>Thorndyke was near his lodgings. He did not
know how he got there, but presently he found himself
sitting in his arm-chair before the fire. Two
hours later, when the maid-servant brought him a
letter, he was sitting in the same position.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>The dusk was closing in, but he saw that the
address was in Constance Maitland&#8217;s handwriting.
Of course she had written to tell him of her engagement&mdash;it
was kind of her so to break his calamity
to him.</p>

<p>The letter lay unopened for half an hour. Then,
with a desperate courage, Thorndyke tore open the
envelope. It was an invitation to dinner two weeks
hence. It was unfeeling of her to do this. It was
ignoble to forget that dear, lost past of which she
had often spoken to him, and had allowed him
freely to speak to her. It was impossible that he
should accept; it was impossible that he should
voluntarily meet Constance again, except for one
last interview&mdash;that final leave-taking which is like
the last farewell to the dying. And the sooner it
was over the better. Thorndyke pulled himself together,
and made up his mind to go to Constance
at once.</p>

<p>As he walked along the streets in the sharp air
of the January twilight, everything looked unfamiliar
to him. His interior world was destroyed&mdash;engulfed.
Never more could he know hope or
happiness; for him was only that stolid endurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
of life which is like a prisoner&#8217;s endurance of his
cell and his shackles.</p>

<p>When he reached Constance Maitland&#8217;s door, she
was at home, and he walked into the familiar drawing-room.
She was sitting on the great, deep sofa,
with no light but that of the blazing wood fire, although
it was quite six o&#8217;clock. She rose as Thorndyke
entered and greeted him gaily. Her meditations
seemed to have been singularly happy.</p>

<p>Thorndyke sat down on the sofa by her, and, as
all men do under stress of feeling, put his pain into
the fewest words possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard this afternoon,&#8221; he said, in a strange,
cold voice, &#8220;of your engagement to Cathcart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; replied Constance, smiling brightly.
&#8220;From whom, pray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Miss Standiford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that crazy Letty Standiford goes about announcing
my engagement!&#8221; There was a pause,
and then Thorndyke said, in the same strange, cold
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cathcart is an admirable man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So everybody says,&#8221; brightly responded Constance.
&#8220;Many persons have assured me of that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>A longer pause followed. It might be ungenerous
to interject a note of pain into her first happiness,
but it is human to cry out, to justify one&#8217;s
self, to call attention to the gift, when one has
given a heart and a soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Cathcart can give you even a part of the fortune
you will lose by marrying him, he is right to
ask you. I could give you nothing. And so,
although I have loved you for nineteen years, I
could not ask you to descend from wealth to poverty
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not lose, perhaps, as much as you think
by marrying an American,&#8221; replied Constance to
this, adjusting her draperies in the light of the fire,
which played over her face. How bright, how smiling
she was! Her dark eyes shone, and the faint
dimple in her cheek kept coming and going. &#8220;I did
not, of course, relish the thought of spending all
my life alone,&#8221; she continued, laughing shamelessly.
&#8220;I was very young, you may remember. So
I determined to save up all I could of my income.
It was easy enough, living, as I did, with a person
who was most of the time a helpless invalid. Then,
my uncle, von Hesselt, realising the injustice done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
me by my aunt, left in his will a considerable sum
of money, which was to be paid me if I lost my
aunt&#8217;s fortune through marrying an American.
This was no more than fair, as my aunt left the
money to the von Hesselts in case I should marry
an American. My lawyers here have assured me
that it is an open question whether I could not,
after all, marry whom I will, and retain the money,
because the terms of the reversion to the von Hesselts
are very obscure, and it might come at last to
my aunt&#8217;s heirs-at-law, of which I am the chief.
But I hate publicity and lawsuits and all such
things, and as I am still reasonably well off, I concluded
to spare myself such agonies, and to be satisfied
with much less than I have now. But it will
be enough to give me all I want in any event. I can
keep this house, my carriage and servants, and
dress well. What more does any one want?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she continued speaking, Thorndyke&#8217;s agony
increased with every word. If only he had known
before! Possibly&mdash;ah, how vain now was it! How
hopeless, how full of everlasting pain!</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Constance kept on, &#8220;Mr. Cathcart is
not the man for whom I should sacrifice even so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
much. He has never hinted that I should marry
him. I am sure he does not want me. I cannot
imagine how such an absurd report got out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorndyke felt stunned. He said, after a moment:</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are not engaged to Cathcart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. Have I not just said that he
has never asked me to marry him? And that <i>he</i>
is not the man for whom I would sacrifice any part
of my fortune?&#8221;</p>

<p>She emphasised the &#8220;he,&#8221; and her words were full
of meaning.</p>

<p>Poor Thorndyke was so dazed, so overwhelmed,
that he could do nothing but stare stupidly into
Constance&#8217;s face. The man who really loves and
suffers is generally stupid at the supreme moment.
And as she looked into his eyes, so full of longing
and yet half-despairing, she turned her head aside
and held out her hand a little way, and he caught
it in his.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ten minutes afterward Scipio Africanus poked
his head in the door and saw that which made his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
eyeballs bulge an inch from his head. At the same
moment the bell rang sharply.</p>

<p>Scipio opened the front door, and, announcing
that Miss Maitland was at home, showed Julian
Crane and Annette into the drawing-room. As
they walked briskly to the fireplace, they saw the
two persons on the sofa start apart. Thorndyke
rose to his feet. Having been accepted, he was once
more master of himself and of the situation. Constance
cowered in the corner of the sofa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray excuse us,&#8221; cried Annette, laughing,
blushing, and hesitating.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to excuse,&#8221; replied Thorndyke,
smiling coolly. &#8220;Miss Maitland has just
promised to marry me. I am sure I don&#8217;t know
why, but I am very much obliged to her all the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annette reached out and took Thorndyke&#8217;s hand
in hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know why,&#8221; she said, &#8220;any woman would
know why.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane shook Thorndyke&#8217;s hand warmly.</p>

<p>Constance, too, rose, and without a word, but
with rapture in her eyes and smile, received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
Annette&#8217;s kiss and Crane&#8217;s cordial grasp of the
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Annette, &#8220;you are too blissfully
happy to be interested in anything now, but
when you come to your senses, I am sure both of
you will rejoice with us. We have just had a despatch
from Senator Bicknell, saying my husband
was elected Senator at four o&#8217;clock to-day on the
fifth ballot.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Crane spoke, with sincerity in his eye
and his smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;We came straight to you for sympathy in our
good fortune, for which we are wholly indebted to
Senator Bicknell. And we find you enjoying the
good fortune that befell us ten years ago. Ah, there
is no such good fortune on this earth, Thorndyke,
as a good wife!&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
